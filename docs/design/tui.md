# dtui — Design

**Status:** Phases 1–3 implemented (see [../dev/phases.md](../dev/phases.md));
Phase 4 (read-only asset browsing) proposed.

dtui is its own Go module and binary; `dtctl tui` forwards to the `dtui`
binary on PATH ([ADR-0004](../adr/0004-separate-module-and-binary.md)). Code paths in this document are relative to the dtui module
(`main.go`, `internal/tui/…`); `pkg/…` and `sdk/…` refer to the dtctl root
module it consumes.

## Overview

dtui is an interactive terminal UI for Dynatrace — launched as `dtui` or
`dtctl tui` — in the
spirit of [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) for Kubernetes: a persistent, keyboard-driven
navigator over the **primitives of an observability platform**. The user thinks
in nouns — services, hosts, pods, logs, traces, problems, frontends, cloud
resources — types an alias (`:svc`, `:pods`, `:logs`), and moves between them
with single keystrokes that follow the topology.

The defining design decision: **DQL is the substrate, not the interface.**
Every view is a curated query under the hood, and every drill-down composes
scope (entity + timeframe) into the next query automatically — but the user
never has to write DQL to navigate. A "reveal query" escape hatch exposes the
generated DQL for the moment curation runs out.

The design is grounded in two inputs:

1. **The dtctl codebase** — existing verbs/resources, the output layer's
   renderers (tables, sparklines, braille graphs, progress bars, live/watch
   modes), and the config/safety model the TUI must respect.
2. **The [dynatrace-for-ai](https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-for-ai) repo** —
   Dynatrace's official skills catalog, which both enumerates the platform's
   surface area (the view catalog below mirrors its skill domains) and encodes
   the canonical investigation flows (problem → entities → logs → traces).

dtctl's `ARCHITECTURE.md` already listed "Interactive Mode: TUI using
bubbletea/lipgloss" as a future idea; this document turns that line into a
concrete design.

---

## Background: What a Dynatrace User Expects to Navigate

Distilled from the `dynatrace-for-ai` skills catalog, the platform's surface
area falls into three layers:

- **Entities (topology)** — things that exist: services, hosts, processes,
  containers, Kubernetes objects, cloud resources (AWS/Azure/GCP), databases,
  web/mobile applications. Connected via **Smartscape** relationships
  (`runs_on`, `belongs_to`, `calls`, `instance_of`).
- **Signals (streams)** — things that happen: logs, spans/traces, metrics,
  events (deployments, K8s events, Davis events), Davis **problems**, security
  findings, RUM sessions/errors/Web Vitals, billing/usage events.
- **Assets (management)** — things you configure: SLOs, workflows, dashboards,
  notebooks, anomaly detectors, settings, extensions — dtctl's existing CRUD
  surface.

The skills also encode two hard platform rules that shape navigation:

- **Broad, unscoped signal queries fail** (Grail's 500 GB scan limit). Signals
  must be entered *through* an entity or a problem, which supplies scope.
- **Every signal query carries entity + timeframe.** Drill-down navigation must
  compose that scope so the user never types it.

And one canonical flow that every shipped workflow prompt follows:

```
Problem ──▶ affected entities ──▶ scoped logs ──▶ related traces ──▶ root cause
```

A TUI's job is to make *entities the map* and *signals the terrain*: browse the
map freely, and drop into any signal already scoped to where you're standing.

---

## Goals

1. **Broad primitive coverage** — every noun a Dynatrace operator expects
   (services → cloud infra → frontends) is a named view, reachable in ≤2
   keystrokes plus an alias. Coverage is broad across nouns and capped in
   depth per noun ([ADR-0014](../adr/0014-breadth-not-depth.md)).
2. **Topology-following navigation** — from any entity, jump to its related
   entities and its signals with single keys; scope composes automatically.
3. **No query language required** — curated views with sensible columns
   (services show RED metrics, hosts show CPU/mem/disk, pods show restarts)
   cover the 95% path; DQL remains available as an escape hatch, never a
   prerequisite.
4. **k9s-grade navigation ergonomics** — command bar with fuzzy aliases,
   breadcrumbs, back/last-view toggles, scope pinning, filtering, sorting,
   hotkeys — fast enough to live in.
5. **Respect the existing model** — contexts, keyring credentials, safety
   levels, agent detection, and color rules behave identically to the CLI.
6. **Reuse, don't fork** — the TUI is a presentation layer over
   `pkg/resources/`, `pkg/exec/`, and `sdk/`; no duplicated business logic.

## Non-Goals

- **Not a query IDE.** The DQL escape hatch is one view, not the center of
  gravity.
- **Not a dashboard renderer.** Dashboards/notebooks are listed and opened via
  browser deep links, not rendered as tiles.
- **Not an agent surface.** The TUI never activates in agent mode (`--agent`,
  detected AI environments, non-TTY); agents keep the JSON envelope.
- **Not a replacement CLI.** Every view shows its CLI/DQL equivalent
  ("command echo"), so the TUI teaches the CLI rather than hiding it.
- **Not a mutation surface — strictly read-only, by decision.** dtui never
  creates, edits, deletes, or executes anything; mutations are not deferred,
  they are out of scope entirely, mainly to limit the project's complexity
  ([ADR-0011](../adr/0011-strictly-read-only.md)). The command echo is the
  handover: dtui shows you the dtctl command, you run it where the safety
  model lives.
- **Not an analysis surface.** Open-ended correlation, hypothesis testing,
  dashboard building, and visual depth belong to the web UI; mutation and
  automation to the CLI ([ADR-0012](../adr/0012-navigate-analyze-mutate.md)).
- **No new SDK API surface** for phases 1–3.

The full scope charter — audience, the TUI/web/CLI boundary, query and
latency budgets, the feature-admission gate, and the standing anti-goal
list — is [vision.md](vision.md).

## The Surface Area: View Catalog

Every view has a canonical name, k9s-style short aliases, curated columns, and
a set of drill-downs. Views are declarative (`ViewSpec`, see Architecture) so
adding one is configuration, not plumbing.

### Entity views (the map)

| View | Aliases | Backing data | Curated columns | Enter drills into |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Services | `:services`, `:svc` | Smartscape + `dt.service.request.*` | name, technology, requests/min ▁▃▅ , error % , p95 latency, active problems | service detail (RED charts + endpoints) |
| Hosts | `:hosts`, `:ho` | Smartscape + host metrics | name, OS, CPU % ▁▃▅, mem %, disk %, net, state, problems | host detail (processes, containers) |
| Processes | `:processes`, `:ps` | Smartscape | name, CPU ▁▃▅, mem ▁▃▅, technology, containerized, host | process detail |
| Containers | `:containers`, `:ct` | Smartscape / container metrics | name, CPU ▁▃▅, mem ▁▃▅, image, pod | container detail |
| K8s clusters | `:clusters` | Smartscape (K8s) | name, version, nodes, pods, CPU/mem pressure, problems | nodes of cluster |
| K8s nodes | `:nodes`, `:no` | Smartscape (K8s) | name, cluster, status, CPU/mem alloc, pods, conditions | pods on node |
| K8s namespaces | `:namespaces`, `:ns` | Smartscape (K8s) | name, cluster, workloads, pods, quota usage | workloads in namespace |
| K8s workloads | `:workloads`, `:dep` | Smartscape (K8s) | name, kind, namespace, desired/ready, restarts, age, problems | pods of workload |
| K8s pods | `:pods`, `:po` | Smartscape (K8s) | name, namespace, node, phase, ready, restarts, OOMKills, age | pod detail (containers, K8s events) |
| Cloud: AWS | `:aws` | Smartscape (AWS) | grouped by service: EC2, RDS, Lambda, ELB, ECS/EKS… → per-type list with type-appropriate columns | resource detail |
| Cloud: Azure | `:azure` | Smartscape (Azure) | VMs, AKS, SQL, App Service, Functions… | resource detail |
| Cloud: GCP | `:gcp` | Smartscape (GCP) | GCE, GKE, Cloud Run, Pub/Sub… | resource detail |
| Databases | `:databases`, `:db` | Smartscape + DB spans | name, technology, host, calls/min, failure %, avg latency | statement hotspots (from spans) |
| Web apps (RUM) | `:frontends`, `:apps-web` | RUM (`user.*`) | name, type, active sessions, Apdex/Web Vitals (LCP/CLS/INP), JS error rate | frontend detail (vitals, errors, sessions) |
| Mobile apps | `:apps-mobile` | RUM | name, platform, sessions, crash rate, top crash | crash groups |
| Entities (generic) | `:entities`, `:topo` | `smartscapeNodes` | any type — free browse of the topology when no curated view fits | entity detail + relations |

### Signal views (the terrain)

Signal views opened from the command bar default to a safe scope (current
pinned scope, or a guided entity picker if the query would otherwise be
unbounded). Opened via drill-down they inherit the selection's scope.

| View | Aliases | Backing data | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Problems | `:problems`, `:pb` | `dt.davis.problems` | severity, status, title, root cause, impact, age; **the investigation entry point** |
| Logs | `:logs` | `logs` | live-follow toggle, severity coloring, grouped-by-pattern mode, record inspector |
| Traces | `:traces`, `:spans` | `spans` | span list with lenses (roots · errors · exceptions · server · client · db · rpc · messaging · genai · all, tab/[/] cycle — digits stay global at the top level); errors and exceptions deliberately coexist: errors = spans that *failed* (with an ERROR column carrying the minimal why — HTTP status, gRPC status, exception type), exceptions = spans that *threw* (~98% of which are not failed); trace-ID lookup (`:trace <id>`); waterfall view |
| Metrics | `:metrics` | `timeseries` | metric browser for the scoped entity; braille/sparkline charts |
| Events | `:events` | `events`, `dt.davis.events` | deployments, K8s events, Davis events; filterable by kind |
| Security | `:security`, `:vulns` | `security.events` | vulnerabilities: DSS score + Davis badges (exposure/exploit/fix), open·muted·all lenses, entity pins; enter → tabbed page (overview · entities · attacks · entry points · timeline · details), markdown description via glamour |
| Attacks | `:attacks`, `:rap` | `security.events` | Runtime Application Protection detections: Blocked/Audited verdicts, payloads, source IPs, `s` → trace waterfall, entity drills |
| RUM sessions | `:sessions` | `user.sessions` | per-app user sessions, duration, errors; session detail = action timeline |
| Costs | `:costs`, `:dps` | `dt.system.events` | DPS consumption by capability/entity, trend |

### Management views (assets — secondary)

The existing generic resource browser: `:slos`, `:workflows` (+ executions with
live log follow), `:dashboards`, `:notebooks`, `:documents`,
`:buckets`, `:detectors`, `:settings`, `:extensions`, `:edgeconnects`,
`:users`, `:groups`, … — one `ResourceView` implementation configured per type
from the existing `pkg/resources/<name>` display fields. These get list /
filter / describe / open, but no bespoke layouts — and no mutations, ever
([ADR-0011](../adr/0011-strictly-read-only.md)); editing stays in the CLI.
(`:segments` is taken: it opens the segment *picker* — the global scope of
section 4 below — not a management table; managing segments stays in the CLI.)

---

## Navigation Model

This is the heart of the design. Navigation has four mechanisms that compose:
**aliases** (jump anywhere), **drill-downs** (follow meaning), **relations**
(follow topology), and **scope** (carry context).

### 1. Command bar — `:`

- `:` opens the command bar; typing fuzzy-matches view names and aliases
  (`:po` → pods, `:sv` → services) with an inline completion popup.
- Arguments narrow the jump: `:logs error`, `:pods checkout`, `:trace <id>`,
  `:ctx prod-eu`. A bare `:ctx` (no name) opens a picker over the configured
  contexts with the current one marked.
- `:q` quits, `:help` opens the key reference.

### 2. Drill-down vocabulary — the same keys everywhere

A single, consistent verb vocabulary; every view supports the subset that makes
sense. Learn it once, use it on anything:

| Key | Meaning | On a service | On a pod | On a problem | On a log record |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `enter` | primary detail | service detail | pod detail | problem detail | full record |
| `l` | logs | service logs | pod logs | problem-scoped logs | — |
| `s` | traces/spans | service traces | pod traces | problem-scoped traces | jump to trace |
| `m` | metrics | RED charts | pod metrics | RC entity metrics | — |
| `p` | problems | problems on service | problems on pod | — | — |
| `v` | events | deployments/events | K8s events | evidence events | — |
| `x` | related entities | host, callers, callees | workload, node, ns | affected entities | source entity |
| `u` | RUM sessions (frontend detail) | — | — | — | — |
| `d` | describe (YAML pager) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `o` | open in browser — "open with" picker when several targets apply | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

All of `l s m p v u` open the target view **pre-scoped to the selection and the
active timeframe** — this is how the "never run an unscoped query" rule becomes
structural rather than advisory.

### 3. Relations — `x`, the topology hop

`x` on any entity opens the **relations panel**, populated from Smartscape:

```
┌ relations: checkout-svc (SERVICE) ─────────────────┐
│ runs on        host-4711            HOST           │
│ instance of    checkout             SERVICE_GROUP  │
│ calls          payments-gw          SERVICE        │
│ called by      edge-gateway         SERVICE        │
│ part of        prod-cluster/shop    K8S_NAMESPACE  │
└─────────────────────────────────────── enter: go ──┘
```

`enter` navigates to that entity's detail view. This one panel makes the whole
topology walkable: service → host → its other processes → a noisy neighbor;
pod → workload → namespace → the sibling workload that's actually broken.

### 4. Scope — pin where you're standing

- `.` on any entity **pins it as the global scope** (shown in the header, e.g.
  `⌖ ns: shop-prod`). While pinned, every view opened from the command bar is
  filtered to it: `:pods` shows the namespace's pods, `:logs` the namespace's
  logs, `:problems` its problems. `.` again (or `ctrl-x`) unpins.
- Pinning composes with drill-down scope; drill-down always wins (it's more
  specific).
- `t` opens the **timeframe picker** (30m / 2h / 24h / 7d / custom); the active
  timeframe is global and applies to every metric column and signal view.
- `S` (or `:segments`) opens the **segment picker** — a multi-select over the
  tenant's Grail filter segments (space toggles, enter applies, up to 10,
  AND-combined per Grail semantics). Applied segments are the fourth global
  state (context, timeframe, pin, segments): they live on the shared
  `dataSource` and are injected into **every** DQL query as `filterSegments`
  on `query:execute`, so all views honor them with zero per-view plumbing; a
  change just broadcasts `Refresh()`. The header shows `◐ <name> [+N]`,
  dimmed on API-backed views (slos/detectors/log-patterns bypass
  `query:execute`, so the scope can't reach them and `jumpTo` says so). A
  project's `.dtui.yaml` — found by walking up from the cwd, committable
  to the repo — pre-selects segments at startup: resolved async against the
  tenant list by exact UID, then exact case-insensitive name; unknown or
  ambiguous refs warn instead of guessing. Segments with variables prompt for
  values right in the picker: space-toggling an unbound one opens a **value
  sub-picker** (the variable definition DQL runs through the shared
  dataSource; result columns are the variable names, rows the candidates;
  `/` filters, enter binds, esc cancels the toggle — mirroring the web UI's
  secondary selection), and `v` reopens it later to edit bindings, including
  workspace-supplied ones. A still-missing binding surfaces Grail's
  `FILTER_SEGMENT_REQUIRES_VARIABLE` error rewritten with TUI remedies
  instead of CLI flags. `alt+s` suspends the applied set in place — one
  keypress for the unfiltered picture, one to restore the exact same scope,
  selection and bindings intact (the pill dims to `◌ … off`) — so a
  workspace-seeded scope toggles without a trip through the picker. The
  workspace file can also set the startup view, timeframe, and preferred
  environment (see the dtui README).

### 5. Movement & recall

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `esc` | back (pop breadcrumb stack; view state and data preserved) |
| `-` | toggle between the two most recent views (k9s-style) |
| `H` | **history** — every breadcrumb trail visited, persisted per context across sessions (`~/.local/state/dtui/history.json`); enter restores the whole trail (data refetched, timeframe reapplied) |
| `/` | incremental filter of the current table (client-side, per keystroke); **enter adds it as a server-side `\| search`** over every field of the unfetched dataset (terms stack as AND), **alt+enter replaces** the active terms; `esc` clears |
| `f` / `F` | **facet manager** — active filters listed first (enter edits in place, `ctrl+x` removes one), below them the attributes (quick-search over the fetched records' keys) to add a new facet: pick a value from the server's `fieldsSummary` top values, or type a `*` pattern (`payment*`, `*ayment*`); filters stack, render as pills, survive refresh/timeframe, and persist into history / `F` clears them all (esc-chain clears too). On bucket-backed views `dt.system.bucket` is pinned first (tagged `bucket`): buckets are Grail's physical data separation, so a bucket facet prunes reads at the source — its filter injects right after the fetch, and every record is projected with its bucket (`fieldsAdd dt.system.bucket`) so the inspector shows it |
| `f` (inspector / details tab) | facet the **list beneath** by the selected field's value — scalars apply exactly, array elements as a contains pattern; refused with a message when the list's rows don't carry the field |
| `shift-j/k` | sort by column, toggle direction |
| `0`–`9` | hotkeys — fixed view bookmarks (0 home, 1 problems, 2 services, 3 hosts, 4 pods, 5 logs, 6 traces, 7 workloads, 8 events, 9 aws); on entered pages digits follow the numbered tab strip |
| `r` / `R` | refresh now / cycle auto-refresh (off/10s/30s/60s) |
| `ctrl-q` | **reveal query** — open the current view's generated DQL in the query escape hatch |
| `c` | copy the equivalent dtctl command for the current view |
| `?` | help overlay (all bindings, per-view) |

**Breadcrumbs** render in the header:
`problems ▸ P-2407 ▸ logs (checkout-svc, 14:02–14:31)` — every element of the
path carries its scope, and `esc` walks back up with state intact.

### Example journeys

**Incident triage** (the `dt-incident-response` flow, ~8 keystrokes):
`1` (problems) → `enter` on the critical one → `l` (logs, pre-scoped, grouped
by pattern) → `enter` on the top error group → `s` (jump to its trace) →
waterfall shows the failing downstream call → `x` → the culprit service →
`v` shows a deployment event 4 minutes before the problem started.

**K8s crashloop**: `:po` → `/crash` → `enter` on the pod → `v` (K8s events:
OOMKilled) → `x` → workload → `m` (memory chart: sawtooth against the limit)
→ `.` pin the namespace → `:events` to see what else changed there.

**Slow frontend**: `:frontends` → sort by LCP → `enter` → Web Vitals panel →
`s` (traces behind the slow pages) → backend service in the waterfall → `p`
(its problems) — frontend-to-backend in five keys, the `dt-obs-frontends`
correlation path.

## User Experience

### Entry point

```bash
dtctl tui                # launch, home view, current context
dtctl tui pods           # launch directly into a view (any alias works)
dtctl tui --context prod # launch against a specific context
```

Guards, checked before entering the alternate screen: not a TTY → error; agent
mode → structured error envelope (`"ui is interactive-only"`); `--plain` →
error suggesting non-interactive equivalents.

### Layout

```
┌ dtctl ─ context: prod-eu ─ safety: readonly ─ ⌖ ns: shop-prod ─ last 2h ⟳ 30s ──┐
│ ▸ pods (shop-prod)                                                          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│ <l>ogs <s>pans <m>etrics <p>roblems e<v>ents <x>rel <.>pin  </>filter <?>   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Header**: context, safety level (color-coded: readonly green,
  readwrite-mine yellow, readwrite-all/unrestricted red), pinned scope,
  timeframe, refresh; breadcrumb line below.
- **Footer**: the drill-down vocabulary available on the current selection,
  plus a transient status line used for errors and **command echo** — after
  every navigation it prints the CLI equivalent, e.g.
  `≡ dtctl query 'fetch logs | filter k8s.pod.name == "cart-6b5d4-mm2yz" …' --from -2h`.

### Home view (`:home`, default)

A triage landing page, echoing `dt-health-check` / `dt-daily-standup`: active
problems by severity, unhealthy-SLO count, top services by error rate, recent
deployment events, failing workflow executions. Panels load independently
(spinner per panel); `enter` on a panel opens the full view.

### The DQL escape hatch (`:query` / `ctrl-q`)

One view, deliberately last in this document: a query editor + results pane
with the existing live progress (scanned GB / records via the SDK's
`PollUpdate`), cancellation, renderer cycling (table → sparkline → braille →
bar), and query history. Its main entrance is `ctrl-q` from any view —
**reveal the query behind what you're looking at**, tweak it, and re-run. This
is where curated navigation gracefully hands over to power users, and it makes
the TUI a DQL *teacher*: every screen can show you how it was made.

### Strictly read-only

The TUI never mutates anything — no create, edit, delete, or execute, on any
view, under any safety level. This is a deliberate scope cap, mainly to limit
the project's complexity ([ADR-0011](../adr/0011-strictly-read-only.md)): the
CLI already owns mutations, their confirmation semantics, and the safety
model, and duplicating that stack in a TUI (`$EDITOR` suspend/restore,
type-to-confirm modals, ownership resolution) buys little. The handover is
the **command echo**: `c` copies the equivalent dtctl command for what you
are looking at, and you run it where the safety checker lives. The header
still shows the context's safety level color-coded — it identifies the
credentials the session holds, even though dtui itself gates nothing on it.

---

## Detail Pages

`enter` on any row opens a detail page. The designs below are grounded in a
live-tenant exploration with dtctl itself (Smartscape node shapes, verified
edge types, `fieldsSnapshot logs/spans`, the `metrics` command, and the
`dt.semantic_dictionary` tables) — every field and metric named here was
confirmed to exist. Where the tenant taught us a gotcha, it's called out.

### Common anatomy

Every detail page shares one chrome:

```
┌ svc: checkout-svc ──────────────── SERVICE · SERVICE-4F2A9C… · ⧉ 2 problems ┐
│ runs on 3 pods · prod-cluster/shop · seen 42d · last 2h                      │
│ ╭──────────╮──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│ │ Overview │ Endpoints   Infrastructure   Problems                          │
│ ╰──────────╯                                                                 │
│  <tab body>                                                                  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ <1-9>/<tab> switch tab  <l s m p v x u> signals  <o>pen <d>escribe <esc> ba │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Identity header** (2 lines): display name, type badge, entity ID
  (truncated, `y` to yank), problem indicator, and a *relationship one-liner*
  built from Smartscape references (where it runs, what it belongs to, age
  from `lifetime`).
- **Tab bar**: the tabs are numbered and the digits switch them directly
  while the page is entered (`0` stays the global jump home); `tab` /
  `shift-tab` cycle them. When the active tab shows its own lens strip,
  the numbering — and the digits — migrate to that strip (the innermost
  numbered strip always owns them). `[` / `]` never touch the tab bar —
  the brackets always drive the active tab's own lens strip. Tabs hold
  content that *belongs to* the object (summaries, embedded lists, charts).
  The signal keys (`l s m p v`) keep their global meaning — they *leave* the
  page into a full, pre-scoped signal view. Rule of thumb: tabs answer "what
  is this thing's state?", signal keys answer "let me dig into its telemetry".
  Curated tabs come first (containment, then metrics and the signals); the
  **related** tab — the full unranked edge list — is always the last tab.
- **Lazy tabs**: each tab loads on first focus (spinner per tab), so opening a
  detail page costs one query, not five.
- Every chart on a tab is a `timeseries` query over the global timeframe;
  every embedded list is `enter`-able (rows navigate to their own detail or a
  scoped signal view).

### Problem detail (`:problems` → enter)

The most bespoke page — it is the front door of every investigation.
Grounded in `dt.davis.problems` fields.

| Tab | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Overview** | title, severity/status badges with `event.status_transition`, start + duration, `event.description` (Davis's own explanation, wrapped), impact level, K8s context (`k8s.cluster.name`, `k8s.namespace.name`, `k8s.workload.kind/name`), flags (`dt.davis.is_duplicate`, `is_frequent_event`, `mute.status`, `maintenance.is_under_maintenance`) | `dt.davis.problems` |
| **Evidence** | timeline of the constituent Davis events — kind, type (e.g. `RESOURCE_CONTENTION_EVENT`), start, source entity; `enter` → event detail | `dt.davis.event_ids` → `dt.davis.events` |
| **Impact** | affected-entities table (name, type, → entity detail) — shipped as rows in the Overview tab rather than a separate tab | `smartscape.affected_entity.ids/types` + `affected_entity_names` |
| **Related** | related (non-affected) entities — the wider blast radius (not yet built) | `smartscape.related_entity.ids` |

Signal keys are scoped to **the problem's affected entities and its time
window** (`event.start` → now/close): `l` error logs grouped by pattern, `s`
failed traces, `m` metrics of the root-cause entity, `v` events in the window.
This is the canonical `dt-troubleshoot-problem` flow as four keystrokes.

### Service detail (`:svc` → enter)

**Tenant gotcha**: SERVICE Smartscape nodes are sparse (little more than
`name` and detection version) — everything interesting comes from metrics and
spans. The page is therefore chart- and span-driven.

| Tab | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Overview** | three braille charts over the timeframe: request rate, failure rate %, response time (`avg`, with p90 toggle where percentiles exist); totals + delta vs previous window | `timeseries` on `dt.service.request.count`, `.failure_count`, `.response_time` |
| **Endpoints** | table: endpoint, req/min, fail %, avg/max duration; sortable; `enter` → traces view filtered to that endpoint | `fetch spans \| filter dt.smartscape.service == <id> \| summarize by:{endpoint.name}` |
| **Infrastructure** | where it runs, as an indented tree: pods → containers → nodes → hosts; each row `enter`-able | Smartscape `runs_on` / `belongs_to` edges (verified: SERVICE runs_on K8S_POD/CONTAINER/HOST/PROCESS) |
| **Problems** | problems whose affected entities include this service | `dt.davis.problems` filtered on `affected_entity_ids` |

> **Shipped**: the deployment surface is two pre-scoped real tabs right after
> the details — **pods** and **processes** (full list views: phase/ready,
> sparklines, drills). A service's runtime nodes carry no service field to
> filter by, so the scope is a topology join, validated live on two tenants:
> `smartscapeNodes "K8S_POD" | join [smartscapeEdges "*" | filter source_id ==
> toSmartscapeId(<svc>) and type == "runs_on" | fields target_id],
> on:{left[id] == right[target_id]}, kind:inner` (`ServiceRunsOnStage`). The
> same join lets a SERVICE pin scope `:pods`, `:processes` and `:containers`.
> Containers and hosts stay one hop away on the related tab.

`s` opens the full traces view scoped to
it; `x` walks `calls` edges (callers/callees).

### Host detail (`:hosts` → enter)

HOST nodes are field-rich (`os.*`, `cores`, `memory`, `ip`, `cloud.provider`,
`aws.*`, `hypervisor.type`, `dt.host_group.id`) and the tenant confirms DISK
and NETWORK_INTERFACE as child entities plus a deep `dt.host.*` metric
namespace — enough for a btop-style page.

> **Shipped**: the details tab carries a **vitals block** (CPU %, memory %,
> worst-disk %, net rx/tx sparklines with last/avg/max; enter charts the
> metric) and a pre-scoped **processes** tab is the first tab after the
> details (`Vital` series flags + `containmentTabs` in the code). Disks and
> Network stay future tabs; a host's containers are reachable via `:containers`
> and the related tab.

| **Overview** | identity block + four charts: CPU (`dt.host.cpu.usage`, stacked user/system/iowait/steal toggle), memory (`dt.host.memory.avail.percent`), load (`.cpu.load/load5m/load15m`), disk & net top-lines; the EC2 instance behind it linked via `runs_on AWS_EC2_INSTANCE` | `dt.host.*` metrics + node fields |

| **Containers** | containers on the host: name, image, pod, CPU, memory | CONTAINER `runs_on` HOST |

### K8s pod detail (`:po` → enter)

K8S_POD nodes carry `k8s.pod.phase`, workload/replicaset/node/namespace names,
and full labels/annotations (`tags:k8s.labels`) — plus `dt.kubernetes.container.*`
metrics for the limits/usage story.

> **Shipped**: pod details carry a vitals block (CPU mCores / memory working
> set summed across containers, pod net rx/tx) and a pre-scoped
> **containers** tab. The same pattern covers node → pods (+ vitals from the
> node's host metrics via the `host.name` arm of `MetricScopeFilter`),
> workload → pods, namespace → workloads, cluster → nodes, and process /
> container / namespace / cluster canned metrics.

| Tab | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Overview** | phase, node (→), workload (→), namespace, age, cost center; labels/annotations (collapsed, `L` expands); charts: CPU usage vs requests/limits, memory working-set vs limit, CPU throttling, pod network rx/tx | node fields + `dt.kubernetes.container.cpu_usage/.cpu_throttled/.limits_*/.requests_*/.memory_working_set`, `dt.kubernetes.pod.network_*` |
| **Containers** | per-container: name, image, ready, restarts, CPU/mem vs limits (gradient bars) | CONTAINER `is_part_of` K8S_POD |
| **Events** | K8s events for the pod (created, scheduled, OOMKilled, backoff…) | `fetch events` scoped to pod |
| **Config** | mounted ConfigMaps, Secrets (names only), PVCs with capacity/used | `uses` edges → K8S_CONFIGMAP / K8S_SECRET / K8S_PERSISTENTVOLUMECLAIM + `dt.kubernetes.persistentvolumeclaim.*` |

`l` opens the pod's log stream (follow-capable) — the single most common K8s
action. Workload and node details follow the same pattern: **workload** =
overview (desired vs ready from `dt.kubernetes.workload.pods_desired`,
conditions, HPA via `K8S_HORIZONTALPODAUTOSCALER uses` edge) + pods tab +
events tab; **node** = overview (conditions, allocatable vs usage from
`dt.kubernetes.node.*`, the HOST behind it via `runs_on`) + pods tab.

### Frontend detail (`:frontends` → enter)

Backed by FRONTEND nodes (`frontend.type` web/mobile) and the `dt.frontend.*`
metric namespace, which the tenant confirms includes full Web Vitals.

| Tab | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Overview** | type, instrumentation id; charts: active sessions & users (estimated), user-action rate & duration, error count | `dt.frontend.session.active.estimated_count`, `.user.active.estimated_count`, `.user_action.count/.duration`, `.error.count` |
| **Web Vitals** | LCP / CLS / INP (+ FID, TTFB, DOM-interactive, load-event) charts, each colored against Good / Needs-improvement / Poor thresholds | `dt.frontend.web.page.largest_contentful_paint`, `.cumulative_layout_shift`, `.interaction_to_next_paint`, `.first_input_delay`, `dt.frontend.web.navigation.*` |
| **Errors** | error-rate trend + top error groups | `dt.frontend.error.count` + `user.events` where ingested |
| **Sessions** | recent sessions: user, duration, actions, errors; `enter` → session action timeline | `user.sessions` / `user.events` |

### Database detail (`:db` → enter)

The tenant monitors Postgres deeply: DB_INSTANCE/DB_DATABASE/DB_TABLE/DB_INDEX
entities and a wide `postgres.*` metric namespace — enough for a real DBA page.

| Tab | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Overview** | instance/database identity, connection & conflict trends, I/O and SLRU cache charts | `postgres.activity.*`, `postgres.io.*`, `postgres.slru.*`, `postgres.database_conflicts.*` |
| **Statements** | top statements by calls / total time / failures; `enter` → traces containing that statement | `fetch spans \| filter isNotNull(db.query.text) \| summarize by:{db.operation.name, db.query.text}` |
| **Tables** | per-table rows/size/scans/bloat indicators | DB_TABLE entities + `postgres.tables.*` (28 metric keys confirmed) |
| **Callers** | services calling this database | `calls` edges, backward |

### Cloud resource detail (generic, all `AWS_* / AZURE_* / GCP_*` types)

One generic page covers the ~40 AWS types found in the tenant (EC2, ELB/target
groups, EKS/ECS, RDS/DynamoDB, VPC/subnets/SGs, IAM, …):

| Tab | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Properties** | all node fields, namespaced groups (`aws.*`), tags table | Smartscape node (heavy `aws.object` JSON only fetched on demand via `d`) |
| **Relations** | attached / part-of / uses / used-by, as a two-direction list | `references` (static forward) + `smartscapeEdges` (backward/dynamic) |
| **Metrics** | provider metrics for the resource | `cloud.aws.*` keys filtered by resource dimension |

Type-specific ViewSpecs can add a tab (e.g. target-group → healthy-targets)
without a new page implementation.

### Trace waterfall (traces view → enter)

Confirmed span fields: `span.name`, `span.kind`, `span.parent_id`, `duration`,
`start_time`, `request.is_failed` / `transaction.is_failed`, `endpoint.name`,
`http.route`, `db.system.name` / `db.query.text`, `code.function`, `trace.id`.
Category attributes come in two semconv eras per tenant (see ../dev/learnings.md
§1.11) — filters and columns coalesce both. The kind column badges db
(`⛁ db`) and messaging (`✉ msg`) spans the way GenAI ops already replace it.

```
┌ trace: b617ac8d… ──────────────────── 12 spans · 341ms · 1 failed ──────────┐
│ ▼ POST /checkout                 server   checkout-svc   ████████████  341ms │

```

Tree from `span.parent_id`; bars proportional on the trace's time axis; kind
and service columns; failed spans (`transaction.is_failed` / its deprecated
alias `request.is_failed`, **or** `span.status_code == "error"` — the request
verdict exists only on entry spans) marked `✗` red; spans that recorded
exception events marked `⚡` yellow. Both carry a minimal error brief on the
row (`⟨HTTP 503⟩`, `⟨DEADLINE_EXCEEDED⟩`, `⟨*fmt.wrapError⟩`, or the status
message) so the "why" doesn't need a drill-down, and the header counts both:
`✗ 10 failed · ⚡ 5 threw`.
`enter` on a span → attribute inspector; `l` → logs with the same `trace.id`
(both directions of the logs↔traces link); `x` → the span's service entity.

### Log record inspector (logs view → enter)

Full record in a pager, but **grouped by namespace** rather than flat YAML —
the tenant shows log records routinely carry 50+ fields:

```
│ 14:02:41.113  ERROR                                                          │
│ content   connection pool exhausted: timeout acquiring connection after 30s  │
│ ── kubernetes ──────────────  ── entity ─────────────────  ── http ───────── │
│ cluster    prod-cluster        dt.smartscape.service …      method  POST     │
│ namespace  shop                dt.entity.service     …      status  502      │
│ pod        payments-gw-7d4f…                                route   /charge  │
```

`content` always on top and wrapped; namespace groups (`k8s.*`, `http.*`,
entity IDs, `dt.openpipeline.*`) collapsible; field descriptions from the
semantic dictionary shown on focus (see Runtime discovery). `s` jumps to the
trace when a trace ID is present; `x` to the source entity.

Value rendering rules (implemented in `render.go` / `inspector.go`):

- **Long values expand by default**: `content`, multi-line strings, and any
  string > 160 chars render as a wrapped block instead of a `▸` preview —
  a log record must be readable without a keypress. `enter` still collapses.
- **Callstacks collapse behind their top frame**: stack-shaped fields
  (`code.call_stack`, `code.stacktrace`, `exception.stack_trace` /
  `exception.stacktrace`, `error.stack_trace`) preview as
  `top frame ⋯ 24 frames ▸` — the top frame answers "where", the rest is one
  keypress away. (`vulnerability.stack` is a tech-stack enum, not a stack —
  suffix-matched.)
- **Span events are a first-class section**: a span's `span.events` renders
  as its own section ahead of everything else (instead of a collapsed JSON
  blob in the `span` group) — exceptions loud, `type — message @ file:line`
  always visible with the stack trace collapsed beneath; other events
  (bizevent, feature_flag, message) as compact `k=v` rows that expand
  per-field. Exceptions surface regardless of the status verdict: ~98% of
  exception-bearing spans have `span.status_code` null or `ok` (validated
  live), so nothing else would reveal them.
- **Tall blocks scroll, not leap**: when the selected row is taller than the
  screen (an expanded stack trace, a GenAI prompt), `j`/`k` and the page keys
  scroll the viewport through it before the cursor moves on — the middle is
  readable. `g`/`G` and `enter` (collapse) remain the skip.
- **Expanded JSON is row-per-key**: an expanded object/array contributes one
  selectable row per key/element (`details.nested.service`), so `y` yanks the
  leaf (or a container's subtree as compact JSON) and `enter` follows entity
  ids nested inside the document. The cursor never jumps over a block.
- **Entity ids resolve to names**: every id in the record (top-level, arrays,
  nested JSON) goes into one batched `smartscapeNodes` lookup; resolved names
  render dim next to the id and ride on the link target, so detail pages open
  pre-titled.
- **Group ordering**: ungrouped fields first, domain groups alphabetically,
  `dt.*` always last (pipeline metadata and entity-id plumbing, rarely what
  triage reads first).
- **Page jumps**: `ctrl+d`/`ctrl+u` move the field cursor half a page,
  `pgup`/`pgdn` (`ctrl+b`/`ctrl+f`) a full page — long property lists are
  navigable without holding `j`.

### Findings that shape all pages

Five lessons from the live exploration, baked into the design:

1. **Dual entity-ID eras.** Records carry both deprecated `dt.entity.*` and
   modern `dt.smartscape.*` fields (logs in the tenant have
   `dt.entity.service` *and* `dt.smartscape.service`). Scope filters generated
   by drill-downs must match on either until migration completes.
2. **Entity nodes vary wildly in richness.** HOST and K8S_POD are field-rich;
   SERVICE and FRONTEND are nearly bare and get their substance from metrics
   and spans. `DetailSpec` must let a page be chart-first, not assume
   properties exist.
3. **Silent emptiness.** Wrong node/edge/metric names return empty results,
   not errors. Detail tabs therefore render explicit "no data in timeframe /
   not monitored" states, and the relations panel is driven by *discovered*
   edges (see below), never a hardcoded edge list.
4. **Scoped traces must not open on the roots lens.** Root spans belong only
   to the trace's *entry* service, so `isNull(span.parent_id)` ANDed with an
   entity scope is silently empty for most entities (validated live: 11 of
   the top-15 services on one tenant had zero root spans; "server" is no
   safer — busy internal-only services carry neither). `DefaultSpanLens`
   sends scoped drills/tabs to `all` (GenAI to `genai`); only the unscoped
   `:traces` view keeps roots.
5. **Logs rarely carry service IDs.** Logs are emitted by processes — a
   service is a detection construct — so a plain SERVICE filter reads as
   "this service logs nothing" (validated live: a busy service with zero
   service-stamped lines but ~2k via its process). The logs view therefore
   hops (`Spec.Hop`, `LogHopQuery`): a SERVICE scope resolves its `runs_on`
   PROCESS/CONTAINER Smartscape edges in a pre-query and widens the filter
   to service + runtime entities. Deliberate approximation, same as the
   platform's own service→logs navigation: a process hosting several
   services shows sibling logs too. HOST is excluded (too coarse); K8S_POD
   adds nothing (pod logs match through the container, and logs carry
   `k8s.pod.name` but no `dt.smartscape.k8s_pod`).

---

## Architecture

### Library choice

**bubbletea + bubbles + lipgloss** (charmbracelet), as anticipated in
`ARCHITECTURE.md`. Elm-style `Model/Update/View` fits "views over shared app
state"; async API results and `PollUpdate` progress arrive as `tea.Msg`s;
`bubbles` supplies table, viewport, textinput, spinner, and help widgets.

Alternatives considered: tview/tcell (heavier, imperative) and growing the
hand-rolled ANSI layer (`live.go`, `progress.go`) into a framework (rejected —
input handling, focus, and compositing are exactly what a framework should
own). Consequence to accept: two styling systems — `pkg/output/styles.go` raw
ANSI for CLI output, lipgloss in the TUI. The chart/sparkline/braille renderers
emit plain strings and embed cleanly in either; a `internal/tui/theme` adapter keeps
the palette consistent and delegates capability detection to the existing
`ColorEnabled()` logic. charmbracelet dependencies live in the dtui module
only — **dtctl's root module and the SDK stay TUI-free** (enforced by
`make dtctl-check-lean`).

### The ViewSpec catalog — declarative views

The catalog above must not become thirty bespoke screens. Entity and signal
views are data:

```go
type ViewSpec struct {
    Name      string            // "pods"
    Aliases   []string          // "po"
    Kind      ViewKind          // Entity | Signal | Asset
    List      QueryTemplate     // scope-aware DQL (or resource-handler call)
    Enrich    []MetricColumn    // e.g. CPU sparkline: separate timeseries query,
                                //   batched per page, rendered via output.RenderColoredSparkline
    Columns   []ColumnSpec      // field, header, width, align, colorRule
    Drill     map[Verb]Target   // 'l' → logs view + scope mapping, 's' → traces, …
    Relations RelationSpec      // how to resolve Smartscape neighbors for 'x'
    Detail    DetailSpec        // identity header + []TabSpec (see Detail Pages);
                                //   each TabSpec = query/queries + layout, loaded lazily
}
```

- `QueryTemplate` renders with the current `Scope` (pinned entity, drill-down
  entity, timeframe) — reusing `pkg/util/template`.
- Metric-column enrichment runs as a second, batched query per visible page
  (capped rows, single `timeseries` query with `by:` the entity id), so entity
  lists stay fast and enrichment failures degrade to blank cells, never errors.
- Adding a cloud resource type or a new signal view = adding a ViewSpec, not
  writing a screen.

Management assets use the same table shell configured from the existing
`pkg/resources/<name>` display fields instead of a DQL template.

### Primary-tag columns and projection

Every entity view surfaces the workspace's declared primary tags
(`ds.primaryTags` from `.dtui.yaml`) as extra columns and facet
candidates. The mechanism that makes those columns work differs by how
the spec's query is structured, and **new specs must follow the correct
path or primary-tag columns will be blank for every row**.

**Full-record specs** use `| fieldsRemove` (keep the whole record, strip
named noise). `primary_tags.*` fields survive the pipeline intact.
`table.composeDQL` appends `| fieldsAdd primary_tags.<k>` stages before
the `| sort` / `| limit` tail, which is enough to surface the values.
Set `ProjectPrimaryTags: true` and leave `InjectPrimaryTags` nil.
Examples: hosts, processes, containers (`infra.go`).

**Projection specs** use explicit `| fields a, b, c` or `| summarize
{ … }`, which whitelist-project a fixed column set and drop everything
else — including `primary_tags.*`. A post-hoc `| fieldsAdd` runs after
the projection and yields null for every row because the field was already
gone. The spec must instead embed the keys *inside* the projection boundary:

- `| fields` specs: append `primary_tags.<k>` to the field list.
  `injectPrimaryTagsIntoFields` in `k8s.go` does this generically.
- `| summarize` specs: add `primary_tags.<k> = takeFirst(primary_tags.<k>)`
  inside the summarize body before the closing `}, by:`.
  `injectPrimaryTagsIntoSummarize` in `k8s.go` does this generically.

Set `ProjectPrimaryTags: true` and assign the appropriate helper (or a
custom function) to `InjectPrimaryTags`. Examples: all k8s specs (`k8s.go`).

**Signal views** (logs, spans, events) set neither flag and need no
injection. `fetch logs` / `fetch spans` / `fetch events` keep all record
fields, so `primary_tags.*` appears naturally on records that carry it
(e.g. log records from a service whose OneAgent reports primary tags).
Primary-tag columns are still appended by `primaryTagColumns()` — there is
no `Kind` guard — so those columns appear in the column set and are
populated for records that carry the fields; records without the fields
simply render an empty cell.

**Services** are a special third case: the services list is built from a
`timeseries … scalar:true` roster rather than `smartscapeNodes`. Primary
tags are carried in the `by:` + `takeAny` aggregation of that roster query,
not via the `ProjectPrimaryTags` path at all. See `specs.go` (`servicesSpec`)
and `catalog.go` (`MetricRoster`/`DiscoverQuery`) for the services mechanism.

Decision tree for a new spec:

```
Uses | fieldsRemove?            → ProjectPrimaryTags: true, no hook
Uses | fields or | summarize?  → ProjectPrimaryTags: true, InjectPrimaryTags: <func>
Signal / management view?      → neither
timeseries roster (like svc)?  → MetricRoster path, neither flag
```

### Smartscape tag maps — peek, facet, details

Distinct from primary tags: every Smartscape entity carries its tags as
`tags:<context>` map fields — k8s labels/annotations, cloud provider tags
(`tags:aws`, `tags:azure`, `tags:google_compute_engine`), and custom contexts
(`learnings.md §1.4b`). Which contexts exist is per entity type and per tenant,
so they are discovered, never hardcoded. Three surfaces treat them, sharing one
notion of context ordering and display naming (`tags.go`):

- **Peek** renders whatever `tags:*` maps ride the selected row, grouped by
  context, short keys under a dim header, capped with a fold
  (`tableView.tagPreviewLines`) — zero queries, read from the record in hand.
  `| fieldsRemove` specs carry the maps for free; the k8s `| fields`/`|
  summarize` specs project `` `tags:k8s.labels` `` so it is on the row.
  Annotations are deliberately never projected (open-ended, multi-KB) so the
  peek never shows them.

- **Facet picker** makes every tag key filterable. On picker-open a smartscape
  entity list lazily fires one tag-census query (`SmartscapeTagsQuery`, cached
  per scope; `tagDiscoverCmd`), collects each context's keys client-side, and
  offers them as grouped `<context>:<key>` candidates that trail the scalar
  attributes (curated scalars first via `Spec.FacetPriority`). Selecting one
  seeds a `Facet.MapField/MapKey`; the resulting bracket-subkey filter is
  injected *before* the projection stages (see `composeDQL`/`ComposeQuery`),
  needing no list-query change. Because signals carry no tag maps, discovery is
  gated to smartscape entity lists.

- **Details** need no special handling: the single-record inspector renders
  every record field, so the full `tags:k8s.labels` / `tags:k8s.annotations` /
  cloud tag maps appear as expandable structured entries alongside the manifest.

### Runtime discovery — the environment describes itself

The live-tenant exploration confirmed that Grail is fully introspectable, so
the TUI hardcodes shapes only as *defaults* and discovers the rest per
environment, cached per session:

| Mechanism | DQL | Powers |
|---|---|---|
| Node-type census | `smartscapeNodes "*" \| summarize count(), by:{type}` | which entity views appear in the command bar at all (no `:aws` in an Azure-only tenant), with counts shown in the alias popup |
| Edge catalog | `smartscapeEdges "*" \| summarize count(), by:{source_type, type, target_type}` | the relations panel (`x`) and which drill-downs each detail page offers — never a hardcoded edge list (wrong edges fail *silently* as empty results) |
| Field census | `fieldsSnapshot logs` / `fieldsSnapshot spans` | record-inspector field ordering (by prevalence) and an optional column picker for signal views |
| Metric catalog | `metrics` command (keys + dimensions) | the `:metrics` browser for a scoped entity, and graceful degradation of chart panels when a metric namespace is absent |
| Semantic dictionary | `fetch dt.semantic_dictionary.fields / .models` | on-focus field descriptions, units, and enum values in inspectors; model→table mapping for the generic entity browser |

All five are cheap metadata queries, fetched lazily on first use and cached
for the session (refreshed on context switch). This keeps the ViewSpec catalog
small and honest: curated defaults where curation adds value, introspection
everywhere else.

### Package layout

```text
main.go                  # guards, flag wiring, workspace file, launches tui.App
sources.go               # API-backed view sources (SLOs, detectors, analyzers)
internal/tui/
  app.go                 # root tea.Model: view stack, command bar, routing, global keys
  theme/                 # lipgloss styles; adapter over output.ColorEnabled()
  catalog/               # the declarative view catalog: Specs, query builders,
                         #   scope composition, facets, enrichment (one file per domain)
  table.go               # generic entity/signal table engine driven by Spec
  detail.go              # tabbed entity detail page driven by DetailSpec
  problem.go, vulnerability.go   # bespoke tabbed pages
  waterfall.go, timeline.go      # trace waterfall, RUM session timeline
  inspector.go, render.go        # record inspector + typed value rendering
  navigator.go           # smartscape navigator (overview / browser / walk)
  home.go, query.go, metrics.go, relations.go, segments.go, links.go
  view.go, history.go    # view registry, navigation messages, persisted history
  datasource.go          # async adapters: pkg/exec + resource calls → tea.Cmd/tea.Msg
```

Rules, mirroring existing layering: `internal/tui` imports dtctl's
`pkg/resources`, `pkg/exec`, `pkg/output` (renderers) and the SDK's
`sdk/session` (config, credentials, client, safety); nothing imports
`internal/tui` except the `dtui` main package; no HTTP in `internal/tui`;
every API call is a `tea.Cmd` goroutine with `context.Context` cancellation
tied to view lifetime.

### Refresh & data handling

- Views own their data + `lastFetched`; auto-refresh is a per-view `tea.Tick`
  honoring the global interval. The breadcrumb stack keeps popped views alive
  for instant `esc`.
- `/` filtering and sorting are client-side over the fetched page; entity
  lists are paged (DQL limit + "load more" on scroll-past-end). Server-side
  narrowing is what scope pinning is for — consistent with the "no custom
  query flags" principle.
- Signal views opened without any scope prompt for one (entity picker) rather
  than running an unbounded query.

### Testing

(As built — the original sketch called for golden files and httptest; the
implementation landed on cheaper, less brittle seams.)

- **Model tests**: bubbletea models are pure (`Update(msg) → model, cmd`) —
  the harness in `app_test.go` drives the real app with synthetic key
  messages and asserts navigation, scope composition, and safety gating. No
  TTY needed; inputs run static-cursor and timers at zero delay so no test
  ever sleeps.
- **Catalog tests**: every Spec's `Query` renders against fixture scopes and
  the tests pin the DQL shape with substring checks — catching
  scope-composition regressions cheaply.
- **View assertions**: `View(w, h)` output is checked for content and
  classification via `ansi.Strip` + substring matching — no golden files, so
  styling and layout tweaks don't invalidate tests. Synthetic data only, per
  the privacy rules.
- **Datasource tests**: no HTTP anywhere — the `dataSource.runFn` func seam
  replaces the executor, and API-backed views stub the injected `Source`
  closures. Canned rows are injected via `seedRows`.

## Implementation Status

Phases 1–3 (shell, topology, traces, Kubernetes, cloud, RUM, security,
Smartscape navigator, DQL escape hatch) are implemented; Phase 4 (read-only
management-asset browsing — mutations are not planned at all, see
[ADR-0011](../adr/0011-strictly-read-only.md)) is proposed. The
phase-by-phase shipped log — including design refinements that superseded
sections above — lives in [../dev/phases.md](../dev/phases.md).

### Roadmap — designed above, not yet built

Where this document describes something the code does not yet do, it is one of:

- **Query escape hatch**: live progress, cancellation, and renderer cycling
  (table → sparkline → braille → bar). Progress needs the SDK's `PollUpdate`
  forwarded as `tea.Msg`s; stale results are currently dropped by `(owner, seq)`.
- **Runtime discovery**: the node-type census gating the command bar and the
  field census driving inspector ordering / a column picker. The census query
  exists (`CensusQuery`); the other three mechanisms shipped.
- **Detail pages**: problem *Related* tab; host *Disks / Network* tabs;
  database *Statements / Tables / Callers* tabs; pod *Config* tab (mostly
  nodeless `K8S_SECRET` / `K8S_CONFIGMAP` entities, so low value until they
  carry data).
- **Logs live-follow toggle**: auto-refresh (`R`) already re-queries; missing is
  a logs-specific follow UX (pin to newest, follow indicator).
- **Home**: a recent-changes panel (the change-event query exists).
- **Blocked on data**: `:costs` / `:dps`, mobile apps, Azure/GCP inventories.
- **Smartscape navigator phase 3**: expand-in-place, visited-nodes minimap, trail
  yank, schema-cell drill (see `smartscape-navigator.md`).
- **Phase 4 read-only asset browsing**: `:workflows` and executions,
  `:dashboards`, `:notebooks`, `:documents`, `:settings`, `:extensions`,
  `:edgeconnects`, `:users`, `:groups` — list / describe / open only
  ([ADR-0011](../adr/0011-strictly-read-only.md)); only `:slos` and `:detectors`
  exist today.
- **Intentionally not planned**: user-assignable hotkeys (the 0–9 set is fixed),
  SLOs-targeting-an-entity (SLO definitions carry a selector, not entity ids, so
  there is no reliable join), and mouse support.

## Open Questions

1. **Bare `dtctl` launch**: the command is `dtctl tui`; should a bare `dtctl`
   in an interactive terminal also launch it? Proposal: no — bare `dtctl`
   keeps printing help (agents probe with bare invocations).
2. **Entity list sourcing**: Smartscape (`smartscapeNodes`) vs classic
   `dt.entity.*` fetches — Smartscape is the strategic choice per
   `dt-migration`, but column availability per entity type needs a spike;
   ViewSpec isolates the decision per view.
3. **Metric enrichment cost**: sparkline columns mean one extra timeseries
   query per page per view. Acceptable with paging + caching per refresh tick?
   Needs measurement; worst case they become opt-in per view (`ctrl-m`).
4. **Live log follow semantics**: periodic re-query with advancing window
   (like `--live`) vs tail-style append; append needs stable ordering
   guarantees from Grail — start with re-query.
5. **Windows terminal support**: bubbletea handles Windows, but alternate
   screen + `$EDITOR` suspend needs explicit testing (existing
   `console_windows.go` VT enablement must run before bubbletea init).
6. **Smartscape topology *visualization*** (graph drawing) — resolved by
   Phase 3.8: don't draw, navigate. The smartscape navigator (`:nav`,
   `smartscape-navigator.md`) covers overview, browsing, and
   walking; graph *drawing* stays rejected (hairball + lipgloss compositing
   limits).
