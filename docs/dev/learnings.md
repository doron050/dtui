# Field Notes & Learnings

Working notes captured while implementing dtui. This complements
[the design doc](../design/tui.md): it records the **DQL/Grail facts
validated against a live tenant**, the **TUI extension model**, and the
**traps** that cost time — the things you cannot infer from reading the
code alone.

> **Privacy:** this file is public. All identifiers below are illustrative
> placeholders. Attribute a finding by tenant *kind* (for example "OneAgent-fed
> tenant", "OTel-demo tenant", "demo tenant A") — never paste tenant names or
> short codes, environment URLs or IDs, entity or segment IDs, hostnames, IPs,
> people, customer or app names, internal repo URLs or ticket keys.

## 1. The DQL substrate — facts validated live

Every query in `internal/tui/catalog/` was checked against a real tenant. Grail is
introspectable, but it **fails silently**: a wrong field, wrong id type, or
wrong data-object name returns `{"records": []}` with exit 0 — *no error*. This
is the single most important thing to internalize. Always confirm a query
returns non-empty before trusting a field name.

> **Re-validation pass (2026-07):** every DQL-checkable claim below was
> re-run against two further tenants, a OneAgent-fed tenant (large
> cluster) and an OTel-demo tenant (OTLP). Corrections from that pass are folded
> in inline and marked *(validated OneAgent/OTel-demo tenants)*. One refinement to the
> silent-failure rule: an id-vs-string type mismatch is not *entirely* silent
> — Grail attaches `SEVERE` `QUERY_ALWAYS_EMPTY_FILTER` +
> `EQUALITY_COMPARISON_OF_INCOMPATIBLE_TYPES` entries to
> `metadata.grail.notifications`, even though the record set is empty and the
> exit code is 0. Code that inspects only `records` is still blind to it; a
> consumer that reads `notifications` can detect the trap.

### 1.1 Smartscape is a command, not a table

- `smartscapeNodes "TYPE"` and `smartscapeEdges "*"` are **starting commands**,
  not fetchable data objects. `fetch smartscapeNodes` → `UNKNOWN_DATA_OBJECT`;
  `fetch smartscape.nodes` → `DATA_OBJECT_NOT_SUPPORTED`. A type argument is
  mandatory (`smartscapeNodes` alone → `NO_PARAMETERS_FOR_COMMAND`).
- Multi-type and wildcard both work in one query:
  `smartscapeNodes "K8S_DEPLOYMENT", "K8S_STATEFULSET", "K8S_DAEMONSET"` and
  `smartscapeNodes "K8S_*"` — so a combined "workloads" view is **one query**,
  no client-side merge.
- `from:` is a command parameter: `smartscapeNodes "K8S_POD", from:now()-2h`.
  Without it you get every entity alive at *any* point in the default window —
  including dead pods (`Succeeded`/`Failed`). A "current" view must filter
  `k8s.pod.phase` or lifetime recency.
- Nodes also carry `references` (a lazy forward-only adjacency object) and, for
  K8s, `k8s.object` (the entire manifest as a multi-KB JSON string). **Always
  project** with `| fields ...` or `| fieldsRemove references, k8s.object` in
  the TUI's *list* queries — never fetch full records into a list. The
  single-record detail query keeps both (the manifest and containment edges
  are exactly what a detail page is for; the inspector collapses huge JSON by
  default). Gotcha: `references` is **not in the default projection** — it
  comes back only with an explicit `| fieldsAdd references` (or `fields`)
  clause (validated live; `fieldsRemove references` on a list query is
  therefore belt-and-braces, not load-bearing).

### 1.2 The two ID casts you cannot forget

| Field kind | Comparison requires | Silent-empty trap if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| `dt.smartscape.*` ids (nodes, edges, metric dims) | `toSmartscapeId("SERVICE-…")` | yes |
| span `trace.id` (a UID type) | `toUid("32-hex")` | yes |
| log `trace_id` (a plain string) | plain `== "…"` | n/a (works as string) |
| `dt.entity.*` ids | plain string | n/a |
| plain names (`k8s.pod.name`, `service.name`) | plain string | n/a |

The asymmetry between **span `trace.id`** (UID → `toUid`) and **log `trace_id`**
(plain string) is the crux of the log↔trace jump: a log's `trace_id` value drops
straight into `toUid()` to fetch its spans, and a span's `trace.id` (rendered as
32-hex) drops into a plain `trace_id == "…"` to fetch its logs. Both directions
were round-trip validated.

**Era twins on a record (validated live, OneAgent-fed tenant spans).** A record carries the
same entity under both eras, and a `smartscape_id`-typed field *displays* as the
same plain `TYPE-16HEX` string as its legacy twin (the cast is only needed on the
*comparison* side, above): `dt.smartscape.service` == `dt.entity.service` (byte-
identical `SERVICE-…` id). Not every pair is a twin — `dt.smartscape.process`
(`PROCESS-…`) and `dt.entity.process_group_instance` (`PROCESS_GROUP_INSTANCE-…`)
are different node types with different ids. The record inspector's links block
dedupes exact-id twins, hoisting the current-era `dt.smartscape.*` field and
keeping the legacy twin out of the links block only — it still reads below in
its `dt.*` namespace group (`addLinkRows` in `internal/tui/inspector.go`).

### 1.3 Signal scoping: entity fields differ per record type

The costliest bug of the session. **Log records carry `k8s.*` name attributes
but NO `dt.smartscape.k8s_*` fields.** A logs query scoped only by
`dt.smartscape.k8s_pod == toSmartscapeId(...)` returns *empty* — not an error, a
silently empty table. Davis events, by contrast, carry both.

`catalog.SignalFilter` therefore or-s three matchers: the smartscape id, the
legacy `dt.entity.*` id, **and** the plain `k8s.*` name (via `k8sNameFilter`),
plus `dt.smartscape_source.id`. A nonexistent field in an or-chain compares as
null (harmless), so over-specifying is safe; under-specifying loses data.

Spans carry `dt.smartscape.service` / `dt.smartscape.k8s_*` /
`dt.smartscape.container` — and, on **OneAgent fullstack** tenants, also
`dt.smartscape.host` *(validated OneAgent-fed and OTel-demo tenants: ~98% of spans on the OneAgent-fed tenant, ~73% on the
OTel-demo tenant carry it; `dt.smartscape.service` is present on ~100%)*. The original
"spans have no host field" note held only on a pure-OTLP tenant; on an
agent-fed tenant a HOST-scoped traces filter **does** match, so
`catalog.SpanScopable(HOST) == false` is conservative there and worth
revisiting. `catalog.SpanScopable(type)` still gates the `s` (traces) drill to
the types spans can actually be filtered by.

### 1.4 k8s.object parsing

- Parse with the DPL JSON matcher: `| parse k8s.object, "JSON:obj"`, then
  bracket-access `obj[status][phase]`. **`parseJson()` does not exist**
  (`UNKNOWN_FUNCTION`).
- The JSON matcher types numeric values as **`long`** and booleans as real
  booleans — bracket-access supports arithmetic directly (*validated OneAgent/OTel-demo tenants:*
  `cs[restartCount] + 5` evaluates and stays typed `long`). They only *render*
  quoted (`restartCount:"0"`, `capacity.pods:"29"`) because Grail serializes
  longs as JSON strings (§1.5), so a `toLong()` before `sum()` is defensive,
  not required for arithmetic.
- DaemonSet replica status uses different keys than Deployment/StatefulSet:
  `numberReady`/`desiredNumberScheduled` vs `readyReplicas`/`replicas`. Use
  `coalesce()` across both for a combined workloads READY column.
- `expand cs = obj[status][containerStatuses]` **drops pods with no
  containerStatuses** (some Pending pods). Acceptable for a ready/restart
  summary; know it truncates.
- Kubernetes omits `readyReplicas` entirely when zero are ready — treat missing
  as `0/N`, not `N/A`.

### 1.4b Smartscape `tags:<context>` maps

*Validated on four tenants (demo, OneAgent-fed and Azure-enabled), 2026-07-24.* Smartscape entities carry
their tags as **`tags:<context>` fields, each a `record` (map) of key→value** —
not a single flat field:

- k8s nodes: `` `tags:k8s.labels` ``, `` `tags:k8s.annotations` ``.
- cloud entities/hosts: `` `tags:aws` `` (on all `AWS_*`), `` `tags:azure` ``
  (all `AZURE_*`), `` `tags:google_compute_engine` `` (GCP), and custom contexts
  like `` `tags:environment` ``; processes carry `` `tags:kubernetes` `` too.
- Which contexts exist is **per entity type and per tenant** — discover, never
  hardcode. Grail omits null fields, so a `limit 1` can miss them; scan a sample.
- **Access is bracket-indexed with both segments backtick-quoted**:
  `` `tags:aws`[`Dtp_Stage`] ``. Keys (and the context field) can contain
  `.`/`/`/`:` (e.g. `node.kubernetes.io/instance-type`,
  `app.kubernetes.io/name`), which is why the whole segment must be quoted. Both
  `| filter` **and** `| fieldsSummary` accept this expression directly off
  `smartscapeNodes` — no temporary projection needed (a
  `` | fieldsSummary `tags:azure`[`dt_owner_team`], topValues:5 `` returns
  values, validated Azure-enabled tenant). This is what `catalog.Facet.MapField/MapKey`
  emits.
- **Map facet filters must be injected before any `| fields`/`| summarize`
  stage.** Those stages drop the tag maps, so a filter after them fails with
  `FIELD_DOES_NOT_EXIST` (validated Azure-enabled tenant: HOST/AZURE/K8S). `ComposeQuery`
  places map-facet `| filter` stages in the early-head block (with
  searches/bucket filters); `FieldsSummaryQuery` explores off a stripped
  pipeline (source + leading scope filters only) for the same reason.
- **List specs and the maps they carry.** `| fieldsRemove` specs (hosts, cloud
  resources) keep every `tags:*` map on the row for free; `| fields`/`|
  summarize` specs (k8s) drop them unless projected. The k8s specs project
  `` `tags:k8s.labels` `` (pods via `takeAny` in the summarize — `takeAny` on a
  map returns the record intact; the others on the `| fields` line) so the peek
  can render it. Annotations are intentionally never projected onto rows: they
  are open-ended and multi-KB (e.g.
  `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration`, pod maxAnn≈2.5 KB) —
  still facetable via discovery, never in the peek.
- **Signals do NOT carry these maps.** logs/spans/`metric.series` have no
  `tags:*` (nor `primary_tags.*` unless configured) — only resolved structured
  attributes (`k8s.pod.name`, `aws.region`, `azure.resource.id`). Tag faceting
  is therefore entity-list-only.
- **Note:** The live faceting *mechanism* is the one described here — tag
  discovery + `Facet.MapField/MapKey`. It replaced the earlier
  `Spec.FacetMaps` + projected-`labels`-alias mechanism once sketched in §1.22.
  §1.22 is **not** wholesale obsolete: its tenant-validated field facts
  (manifest-strip trap, which lists carry the maps) and picker-ordering rules
  (`FacetPriority`, discovered-key tail) remain current and are cited by live
  code — only the `Spec.FacetMaps` projection plumbing there is historical.

### 1.5 JSON serialization quirks (dtctl `-o json`)

- **Longs, counts, durations, status codes serialize as JSON strings**
  (`"37"`, `"500"`, `"5194"`), while **floats stay numbers** (`3.1`) and
  **booleans stay booleans**. Sort/parse code must handle both — see
  `catalog.sortable()` and the numeric-string `strconv.ParseFloat` fallback in
  `table.go`.
- Grail **durations** serialize as a string of **nanoseconds** (`"4845165"` =
  4.85ms). `toString(duration)` instead renders seconds. `catalog.FormatNs`
  parses the raw ns.
- **timeseries `interval` is a nanosecond string** (`"300000000000"` = 5m);
  series arrays are `[]any` of `float64` and **`nil`** (empty buckets). Sparkline
  code must tolerate nulls anywhere (see `catalog.FloatSeries`).

### 1.6 Metrics catalog & batched enrichment

- **There is no `dtctl metrics` subcommand.** Discover keys via DQL:
  `fetch metric.series | filter startsWith(metric.key, "dt.kubernetes") |
  summarize count(), by:{metric.key}`. `fetch metric.series | filter metric.key
  == "…" | limit 1` reveals every dimension a series carries (use to find the
  right filter field).
- Batched sparkline enrichment (one query per visible page) works exactly as
  hoped and stays under ~1s for the whole set:
  `timeseries cpu = avg(…), by:{k8s.pod.name}, filter: { in(k8s.pod.name,
  {"a","b"}) }, interval: 5m`. The `in(field, {"a","b"})` **curly-brace set
  literal** is the working syntax; for smartscape ids wrap each element in
  `toSmartscapeId(...)`. Result: one record per key with the by-field as a flat
  JSON key beside the series array.
- K8s metric **units**: all CPU metrics are **millicores** (a 500m limit shows
  as `500`); memory is **bytes**.
- **No restart/OOM metric exists** on the tenant. Proxy via
  `dt.kubernetes.events` filtered by `k8s.event.reason` (OOMKilling/BackOff),
  or `dt.kubernetes.containers` by `container_state`. Note `dt.kubernetes.events`
  is a **metric** (event counts, queried via `timeseries`), *not* a fetchable
  table — `fetch dt.kubernetes.events` → `UNKNOWN_DATA_OBJECT`. Raw K8s events
  are **not** in the `fetch events` table at all — and that table carries more
  than Davis kinds: *(validated OneAgent/OTel-demo tenants)* it also holds `RUM_EVENT` /
  `SDLC_EVENT` / `FLEET_EVENT` / `SYNTHETIC_EVENT` plus a large null-`event.kind`
  bucket, so don't assume `fetch events` is only `DAVIS_EVENT`/`DAVIS_PROBLEM`.
- Not every entity reports every metric: services with no traffic simply have
  **no record** (treat missing as "no data", not zero). The service timeseries
  also emits a record with a **null by-key** — skip it when building the id→series
  map.
- **Process/container/infra dimensions** (validated live, box tenant):
  `dt.process.*` series carry `dt.smartscape.process` AND `dt.smartscape.host`
  AND `host.name` — one query lists a host's processes ranked by CPU.
  `dt.process.cpu.usage` / `.memory.usage` are **percent of host**;
  `.memory.working_set_size` is bytes. `dt.kubernetes.container.*` series
  carry `dt.smartscape.container` plus `dt.smartscape.k8s_{pod,deployment,
  statefulset,daemonset,namespace,cluster}` — the workload/namespace/cluster
  vitals scope by their own smartscape id. `dt.host.*` series carry
  `host.name`, and a K8s node's name equals its OneAgent host name (EKS) —
  `MetricScopeFilter` adds a `host.name` arm for `K8S_NODE`, which is how a
  node page charts real utilization (allocatable-only otherwise).
- **PROCESS/CONTAINER Smartscape nodes join by plain names**: both carry
  `host.name`; CONTAINER carries every `k8s.*` name (pod, workload, namespace,
  cluster) plus `container.image.name/.version`; a process' pod lives in
  `` process.metadata[`KUBERNETES_FULL_POD_NAME`] `` (backtick map access
  filters server-side). EC2 has **no `cloud.aws.ec2.*` CloudWatch keys** on
  box — EC2 utilization lives on the OneAgent HOST entity; CloudWatch coverage
  is rds/networkelb/eks/ecr.
- `container.image.name` on CONTAINER nodes **flaps** between the repo path
  and a bare 12-hex image id (observed live minutes apart) — render whatever
  is there, don't parse it as a URL.

### 1.6b The `metrics` command — the explorer substrate

- The **`metrics` DQL command** enumerates metric *series* — one record per
  metric key + full dimension set, `from:` bounded (`metrics from:now()-2h`).
  It takes no positional args and no `filter:` parameter; narrow with `| filter`
  and aggregate with `| summarize count(), by:{metric.key}` (~0.7s for a busy
  tenant). `| search` and `fieldsSummary` both work after it, so the standard
  table machinery (server search, facets) applies unchanged.
- Per-entity metric discovery is `metrics | filter <scope> | summarize
  by:{metric.key}` — a single pod on a busy tenant showed **~120 keys**
  (dt.kubernetes/containers/process/runtime plus custom OTel app metrics),
  which is why the explorer view exists at all.
- **OTel-exported service metrics carry `service.name` and legacy
  `dt.entity.service` but NOT `dt.smartscape.service`** — and the legacy
  service id is a *different value* than the Smartscape one. Scoping service
  metrics needs the or-chain in `MetricScopeFilter` (both id eras + the name);
  on the test tenant the name clause grew one service's discovered keys from
  3 to ~35 (http.server.*, db.client.*, gen_ai.*, custom app metrics).
- Metric **metadata is absent**: `metric.unit` / `metric.description` are null
  on every series record and `dt.semantic_dictionary.metrics` doesn't exist.
  Explorer charts render unitless; only canned series carry curated units.
- `dt.service.request.response_time` is **microseconds** (µs), not ms —
  cross-validated against `avg(http.server.request.duration)` (seconds, OTel
  convention) tracking within rounding on the same service.
- **A multi-series `timeseries` query returns ZERO records if ANY requested
  metric has no series at all** for the filter — and `default:` does *not*
  rescue an entirely-absent key (it only fills gaps in existing series). This
  silently blanked the whole pod metrics page for pods without limits set.
  The fix is the two-phase flow in `metricsView`: probe availability with
  `metrics … | summarize by:{metric.key}` first, then compose the timeseries
  from the available subset (`MetricsSpec.AvailabilityQuery` / `.Query`).
- Splitting a metric per dimension is `timeseries value = agg(key), by:{dim}`
  — one record per dimension value. Discover the dims by sampling
  `metrics | filter metric.key == "…" | limit 500` and counting distinct
  values client-side (`discoverDims`); series records carry only dims plus
  `metric.key`, so every other field is a candidate.

### 1.7 dt.davis.problems is a transition log, not a problem list

In principle `dt.davis.problems` is a status-transition log, but *(validated
OneAgent/OTel-demo tenants)* it returns effectively **one record per problem** — latest state,
with the lifecycle carried in `event.start`/`event.end` (max 1–2 rows/problem
over 7d; a closed problem is a single CLOSED row, not a separate ACTIVE row).
The `takeLast` summarize idiom below is still the correct, defensive way to get
currently-open problems — it stays right whether a problem emits one row or
many:

```
| sort timestamp asc
| summarize { status = takeLast(event.status), … }, by:{display_id}
| filter status == "ACTIVE"
```

Affected-entity id arrays differ by era: `smartscape.affected_entity.ids` uses
`K8S_*` ids and is often **null**; `affected_entity_ids` (classic) uses
`CLOUD_APPLICATION-…`/`KUBERNETES_CLUSTER-…` and is fuller but doesn't match
`dt.smartscape.host/service` directly. Match with `matchesPhrase` over both.

### 1.8 smartscapeEdges — the relations panel

- Default projection is only `{source_id, target_id, type}`. `source_type`/
  `target_type` are **lazy** — add `| fields source_id, source_type, type,
  target_id, target_type`. Edge records **never** carry names.
- Query **both directions in one query** — source-only misses incoming edges
  (`K8S_SERVICE --routes_to--> pod`, `CONTAINER --is_part_of--> pod`):
  `| filter source_id == toSmartscapeId(ID) or target_id == toSmartscapeId(ID)`.
- Resolve names in a second batched query:
  `smartscapeNodes "*" | filter in(id, {toSmartscapeId(...), ...}) | fields id,
  name, type`. **Not every edge endpoint has a node** (`K8S_SECRET`,
  `K8S_CONFIGMAP` have edges but no node records) — fall back to the raw id.
- Both queries ~0.7s; fine for an interactive panel with a brief spinner.
- **`k8s.pod.name` is NOT unique — scope a pod's children by its smartscape id
  through the `is_part_of` edge, never by name.** A StatefulSet reuses
  `<name>-N` on every namespace and cluster: on OneAgent-fed tenant, `smartscapeNodes
  "CONTAINER" | filter k8s.pod.name == "eventbus-default-js-0"` returned **105
  containers across 35 namespaces / 5 clusters** (validated OneAgent-fed tenant; the user saw
  the same with `dynatrace-server-2`). The unique fix is a topology join on the
  pod id, mirroring `ServiceRunsOnStage` — for that same pod it returned
  **exactly its 3 containers** in the one right namespace (validated OneAgent-fed tenant):
  `| join [smartscapeEdges "*" | filter target_id == toSmartscapeId(POD_ID) and
  type == "is_part_of" | fields source_id], on:{left[id] == right[source_id]},
  kind:inner` — the inner join drops the edge's non-container sources
  (`PodContainsStage`, catalog `smartscape.go`). Name-only matching stays valid
  only for logs/events (`k8sNameFilter`), where records carry no
  `dt.smartscape.k8s_*` fields (§1.3). `dt.smartscape.k8s_pod` is confirmed on
  container *metric series* but **unverified on CONTAINER nodes** — the edge
  join avoids relying on it.

### 1.9 AWS inventory is name-poor

- On a lightweight-poller tenant, `name` is an **empty string** (not null) on
  most AWS nodes; richer-poller tenants populate it on nearly all. Either way the
  fallback stays correct. Display fallback:
  `coalesce(if(name != "", name), ` + "`tags:aws`[`Name`]" + `, aws.arn)`.
  Note the field is literally named `` `tags:aws` `` (colon) and needs backticks.
- Coverage of `aws.account.id` / `aws.arn` / `aws.region` varies by estate
  (global resources like S3 have no region; small estates saw account-id gaps) —
  don't assume any is 100%. `aws.object` may not exist at all (no instance
  type/state/AZ then).
- AWS-only census in one query: `smartscapeNodes "*" | filter startsWith(type,
  "AWS_") | summarize count(), by:{type}`.
- CloudWatch metrics embed the dimension in the key name
  (`cloud.aws.rds.CPUUtilization.By.DBInstanceIdentifier`); scope by
  `dt.smartscape_source.id == toSmartscapeId(...)`.

### 1.9b Azure inventory — name-rich, subscription needs a name lookup

Validated on an Azure-enabled tenant (2026-07). Azure is the parallel of AWS
(§1.9) through the same generic browser, differing in ways the catalog relies on
(`internal/tui/catalog/cloud.go`, `internal/tui/datasource.go`):

- **Region = `azure.location`** (e.g. `eastus`, `australiaeast`);
  **account-analog = `azure.subscription`** — a 36-char GUID, not a number.
  Geography/tenant metadata types that live *above* a subscription
  (`AZURE_MICROSOFT_RESOURCES_LOCATIONS`, `…_LOCATIONS_AVAILABILITYZONES`,
  `…_TENANTS`, …) carry a `null` subscription by construction. These fields feed
  the `resourcesSpec` Azure columns (`ScopeColumns` swaps them in for `AZURE_`
  scopes; AWS/other providers fall through to the static AWS columns), and the
  SUBSCRIPTION column is dropped for the known subscription-less types rather
  than shown blank (`azureSubscriptionless`, hardcoded from the types above).
- **Azure is name-rich** (unlike AWS §1.9): `name` / `azure.resource.name` are
  well-populated, so the display coalesce usually resolves on `name`.
- **Subscription friendly name** lives ONLY on
  `AZURE_MICROSOFT_RESOURCES_SUBSCRIPTIONS` nodes: `azure.subscription` (GUID) →
  `name`. Fetch it with `smartscapeNodes` — **not**
  `dt.entity.azure_subscription`, whose id is a DT-hashed id, not the GUID every
  other Azure node stamps. dtui caches this GUID→name map per session (like
  the semantic dictionary) and enriches rows in place into a synthetic
  `__azure.subscription.name` field (ADR-0016 `__`-hidden key); the browser
  SUBSCRIPTION column and the detail "Azure subscription name" KeyFact read
  that, staying blank (never the GUID) until the cache lands.
- **Azure census in one query:** `smartscapeNodes "*" | filter startsWith(type,
  "AZURE_") | summarize count(), by:{type}`. `prettyType` drops the redundant
  `AZURE_MICROSOFT_` prefix (`AZURE_MICROSOFT_COMPUTE_DISKS` → `compute disks`).
  Serverless functions type: `AZURE_MICROSOFT_WEB_SITES_FUNCTIONS`.

### 1.10 search & fieldsSummary — the facet substrate

All validated live; implementation in `internal/tui/catalog/facets.go`.

- **`| search "text"` placement is constrained.** It works after the source
  command (`fetch`, `smartscapeNodes`) and after `filter`/`fieldsRemove`, but
  is **rejected after transforming commands** — `parse`, `expand`,
  `summarize` — with `SEARCH_COMMAND_NOT_ALLOWED_AFTER`. Inject it directly
  after the source line (`InjectSearches`), never before the sort/limit tail
  (found the hard way on the pods pipeline). **Chained search stages compose
  as AND** (`| search "*a*"\n| search "*b*"`), so stacked terms need no
  expression syntax.
- **`search` matches whole tokens, not substrings.** `search "fss"` does
  *not* match pod `…-fssb5`; `"fss*"` and `"*fss*"` do. Wrap bare terms in
  `*…*` to get the contains semantics a filter box promises. Matching is
  case-insensitive across all fields.
- **`fieldsSummary <field>, topValues: N`** returns one record per field:
  `{field, count, rawCount, values: [{value, occurrence-count}]}` — counts
  are stringified longs, and **values are stringified even for numeric
  fields** (`"2"` for `logical_cores`).
- **Facet comparisons never wrap the field in `toString()`** — a function
  call on the field mutes Grail's index features. `Facet.Stage()` instead
  branches on the shape of the stringified value; all encodings validated
  live against the toString forms they replaced (equal counts, row-level
  where checked):
  - **Plain strings:** `field == "x"` — exact and case-sensitive. No `~`
    leg: `~` is case-insensitive and token-based, so `phase ~ "Running"`
    also matches `"Running fast"` and `"running"`, and
    `dt.system.bucket ~ "logs_product"` matches
    `custom_sen_low_logs_product_limit` (consecutive-token phrase).
  - **Numbers:** `field == 2 or field == "2" or field == duration(2, "ns")`.
    `logical_cores == "2"` is *silently empty* on a numeric field and
    `== 2` on a string field, so both legs are needed; the `duration()` leg
    matches duration fields, whose `fieldsSummary` values are nanosecond
    counts (`"203000"`) that neither `toString(duration)` (renders seconds)
    nor the old encoding ever matched.
  - **Booleans:** `field == true or field == "true"` — `~` never matches
    booleans (server warns), and `== "true"` alone is silently empty on a
    real boolean.
  - **ID-shaped values** (smartscape ID, hex UID, UUID, IP):
    `field == "x" or field ~ "x"`. Typed scalars never equal a string
    literal — `dt.smartscape.host == "HOST-…"` is silently empty with a
    "convert using toSmartscapeId()" warning, same for UID `trace.id` —
    while `~` auto-converts and matches their **exact** string
    representation (case-sensitive for smartscape IDs). Counts equal the
    toString encoding (4102/4102 hosts on logs, 6/6 trace ids on spans).
  - **Hex UID values (16- or 32-hex: `span.id`, `trace.id`, `subtrace.id`)**
    additionally get an explicit `field == toUid("x")` leg —
    `field == "x" or field == toUid("x") or field ~ "x"`. The `~` leg's
    auto-convert is a **token-index trick, not a type conversion**, so it
    is not guaranteed across tenants/Grail versions; `toUid()` is the
    canonical UID comparison. *(validated OneAgent-fed tenant, ~160M spans/2h:* on
    `subtrace.id`, `== "x"` → 0, while `~ "x"` and `== toUid("x")` both →
    the same count for every id tested — parity, but toUid is the honest
    one.)* Adding the leg is **free of risk on non-UID fields**: `toUid()`
    of a non-16/32-hex string, or comparing a plain-string field to a
    `toUid()` value, returns **null / false with no error or warning**
    (`span.name == toUid("…")` → 0), so the leg simply no-ops where it
    doesn't apply. `uidHexShape` gates it to toUid's two accepted lengths.
  - **Patterns:** `matchesValue(field, "pay*")` on the bare field:
    case-insensitive, `*` wildcards at either end, **element-wise on string
    arrays** and accepts smartscape IDs — but returns false on genuinely
    `long`/`double`/UID-typed fields, so wildcard facets on numeric fields no
    longer match (accepted trade-off; only toString could do that). *(validated
    OneAgent/OTel-demo tenants:* this evaluates false with **no error and no warning** — the
    warning noted earlier did not fire; and where a field is ingested with
    mixed types across records, `matchesValue` matches only the string-typed
    subset.) The pattern must be a **compile-time constant** — a `concat()` of
    string *literals* is folded and accepted; only a data-referencing
    expression (`concat(field, "*")`) fails with
    `MANDATORY_PARAMETER_HAS_TO_BE_CONSTANT`.
- **Array fields facet element-wise without toString.**
  `matchesValue(arrayField, "*ELEMENT*")` matches rows whose **string**
  array contains a matching element (equal counts vs the old
  toString-serialization encoding, validated on events). Arrays of records
  or numbers refuse `matchesValue` ("inner type has to be a string or a
  smartscape id") — those facet through the **`~` search operator**
  (`Facet.Tokens`): `arrayField ~ "v"` matches if any element matches, with
  records matching on any nested field name or value and numbers matching
  their exact representation (`array(1,2,3) ~ "3"`). `~` is token-based on
  strings: `"Hello World" ~ "world"` matches, `"HelloWorld" ~ "world"`
  doesn't.
- Facet `filter` stages stay before the sort/limit tail — after a
  `summarize`, that's what makes them filter the exact fields the columns
  (and the facet attribute picker, built from fetched record keys) present.
- **`dt.system.bucket` is the primary narrowing axis — and a whitelist.**
  Buckets are Grail's physical data separation, so a bucket filter prunes
  reads at the source. The field is queryable and `fieldsSummary`-able on
  every bucket-backed table *without* a projection, but only appears in
  responses via `| fieldsAdd dt.system.bucket`. On tables without buckets
  (`dt.entity.*`, `dt.system.buckets`, `dt.semantic_dictionary.*`) any
  reference **fails the whole query** with `FIELD_DOES_NOT_EXIST` — not
  null — so eligibility is the `bucketTables` whitelist (the
  `dt.system.table` values of `fetch dt.system.buckets`, plus the
  `dt.davis.*` / `dt.synthetic.*` views over events, all validated live).
  A single exact bucket facet on a **real table** becomes the fetch
  command's `bucket:{"name"}` parameter — Grail's native physical pruning;
  identical counts to the filter form over a fixed window, and it composes
  with `| search` + the projection (validated live). The `dt.davis.*` /
  `dt.synthetic.*` **views reject the parameter**
  (`PARAMETER_NOT_ALLOWED_FOR_FETCH_VIEW`), and multiple bucket facets must
  AND (a multi-value parameter would OR) — both keep the old head filter
  stage directly after source + search (order validated live), where it
  also survives `summarize`; the projection is skipped for API views, whose
  query is analyzer input.

### 1.11 Span lenses — why the traces view fetches spans directly

The traces list originally aggregated (`summarize … by:{trace.id}`), which was
slower and starved the facet picker: post-summarize only the aggregate fields
exist. Fetching spans directly and slicing with lens filters keeps every span
attribute available. Facts validated live (box tenant, 2h window, ~280k spans):

- **Root heuristic:** `isNull(span.parent_id)` (~33.6k) is the OTel root
  definition and what the lens uses. Dynatrace's `request.is_root_span == true`
  (~42k) is broader — also true on spans whose parent fell outside ingest —
  and the two only overlap on ~31.4k spans; neither subsumes the other.
- **Failure signal:** `span.status_code == "error"` (681) vastly out-catches
  `request.is_failed == true` (7), which exists only on entry spans. The
  errors lens ORs both. `span.status_code` is null on ~99.8% of spans.
- **DB spans:** `isNotNull(db.system.name)` (231k) is broader than
  `db.query.text` (120k) — drivers emit `pool.acquire` etc. without query
  text. The db lens filters on the system attribute (both era names, see
  below), displays the query text with `span.name` fallback.
- **Two semconv eras, disjoint populations.** OTel renamed the database
  attributes on the way to stability (`db.statement` → `db.query.text`,
  `db.name` → `db.namespace`, `db.operation` → `db.operation.name` in
  semconv 1.26; `db.system` → `db.system.name` in 1.30, stable since 1.33) —
  and the two big demo tenants sit on opposite sides. Validated live (4h
  windows): the OneAgent-fed tenant has **1.73M `db.system` / 0
  `db.system.name`** spans (the Dynatrace semantic dictionary itself defines
  `db.system` next to new-style `db.query.text`/`db.namespace` — OneAgent
  emits that mix), the OTLP-fed tenant has **0 / 349k** — the exact inverse.
  *(validated OneAgent/OTel-demo tenants — complicates the clean "two eras per tenant" split:*
  **both** carry `db.system` and **neither** carries `db.system.name`, yet both
  adopted the *new* `db.query.text` / `db.namespace` / `db.operation.name`. So
  the system attribute stayed legacy-named while the rest migrated —
  field-by-field, not tenant-by-tenant. The operational takeaway is unchanged
  and reinforced: OR both spellings of every attribute you filter on.)
  Same story for HTTP (652k spans carry only legacy `http.method`, 4.26M the
  stable `http.request.method`) and messaging (`messaging.operation.type` on
  all 14.6k, legacy `messaging.operation` dup-emitted on a subset). A filter
  or column that reads only one era's name silently loses an entire tenant:
  every category discriminator must OR both, every display column coalesce
  both. `request.is_failed` → `transaction.is_failed` is the same pattern on
  the Dynatrace side (dictionary deprecation; both tenants dup-emit both
  today — `catalog.SpanFailed` checks both).
- **RPC and messaging carve out real subsets.** `isNotNull(rpc.system)`
  (1.9M: grpc, apache_axis, aws_api, dotnet_remoting — OneAgent also leaks
  numeric enums "1"/"2" with meaningful `rpc.service`/`rpc.method` beside
  them) and `isNotNull(messaging.system)` (kafka, artemis, mqseries, aws_sqs
  with `messaging.destination.name` + operation type) each got a lens.
  DynamoDB spans carry `db.system` **and** `rpc.system=aws_api` —
  `SpanCategory` gives db precedence. FaaS spans exist (`faas.trigger`,
  140k) but all also categorize via http/rpc, so no faas lens.
- **GenAI spans:** `gen_ai.operation.name` is the discriminator;
  `gen_ai.system` is empty on this tenant while `gen_ai.provider.name`,
  `gen_ai.request.model`, and `gen_ai.usage.*_tokens` are populated.
- **Multi-line cell values shear table rows.** `db.query.text` routinely
  contains newlines (sqlc header comments); any `\n` in a cell breaks the
  row grid. The table cell primitives (`pad`/`cell` in `table.go`) flatten
  whitespace runs before truncation.

### 1.11b span.events, exceptions, and error visibility

Validated live on both tenants (box 24h, demo 2h windows):

- **`span.events` is an array of records** discriminated by `span_event.name`
  — `exception`, `bizevent`, `feature_flag`, `message`, or free
  instrumentation text ("Enqueued", "Fetch cart"). Box emits only exception
  events; demo has the full zoo (1M+ bizevent, 250k exception per day).
- **Exceptions mostly ride on NON-failed spans.** ~98% of exception-bearing
  spans on demo have `span.status_code` null or `"ok"` (a caught-and-handled
  error, a 404 recorded via `HttpServletResponse.sendError`). Any exception
  surfacing keyed off the status verdict misses nearly all of them — hence
  the dedicated exceptions lens, the preview facts, and the waterfall `⚡`
  badge that are independent of `✗ failed`.
- **Two exception spellings, both live on one tenant.** Grail/OneAgent
  serializes `exception.stack_trace` (plus `exception.id`,
  `exception.file.full`, `exception.line_number`,
  `exception.is_caused_by_root`); pure-OTel SDK events carry
  `exception.stacktrace` (701 events on demo had ONLY that spelling).
  `catalog.SpanEvent.Exception()` coalesces both. Cause chains produce
  multiple exception events per span (2–31 seen).
- **Raw iterative expressions are rejected in `filter` — but `iAny()` makes
  them legal.** `filter in("exception", span.events[][span_event.name])`
  fails with `ITERATIVE_EXPRESSION_FOR_FILTER`, yet
  `filter iAny(span.events[][span_event.name] == "exception")` collapses
  the iteration to a scalar boolean and passes — the exceptions lens uses
  it. Row-for-row equivalent to string-matching the toString-serialized
  array (`contains(toString(span.events), "\"span_event.name\":\"exception\"")`,
  the old encoding: 6/6 spans, 0 disagreements, validated live) without the
  serialize-and-scan cost. Iterative access also works after `expand` or in
  `fieldsAdd`.
- **The request verdict exists only on entry spans.** A deep span that
  errored carries just `span.status_code == "error"` — `catalog.SpanErrored`
  (verdict OR status code) is what the waterfall marks; `SpanFailed` alone
  left every non-entry error span unmarked.
- **Minimal error briefs cover ~98% of failed spans**: HTTP status ≥ 400
  (3.3k of 7.7k failed demo spans carried one) → gRPC status code (numeric;
  `4` = DEADLINE_EXCEEDED — name it) → exception type → `span.status_message`.
  Only ~2% of failed spans carry none of the four (`catalog.SpanErrorBrief`).
- **`code.call_stack` is OneAgent-only and sparse.** 683k demo spans in 4h
  carry it (box: zero; OTel's `code.stacktrace` spelling: zero anywhere), but
  per-endpoint only ~2–17% of spans have it stamped. Stack-shaped fields are
  suffix-matched (`call_stack`/`stack_trace`/`stacktrace`) and collapse
  behind their top frame — `vulnerability.stack` is a tech-stack enum and
  must not match.

### 1.11c Scan limit — a `filter` narrows the result, not the scan

Grail scans every record in the `from:`/`to:` window to *apply* a filter, then
returns the matches. So `fetch spans, from:… | filter trace.id == toUid(…)`
scans the **whole timeframe** — the one-trace filter buys nothing on the scan
side. On a large tenant this is the difference between a usable view and a dead
one: validated live on a large tenant, the trace waterfall over a 30-day window scanned
the full **500 GB** scan limit, gave up after ~78 s, and returned
`{"records": []}` with exit 0 — an empty success, no error (the classic silent
failure). The same query over a **±15 min** window around the span returned the
full 500-span trace in ~4.5 s.

- **Mitigation is to shrink the scan, not the result.** The waterfall now
  anchors its fetch to the originating span's `start_time` (`waterfallPad`,
  ±15 min) — a trace occupies one instant, so a tight absolute window costs
  nothing and dodges the limit. The old reflex of *widening* an empty result to
  24h is exactly backwards on a big tenant (it scans more); it now only fires
  for the anchorless manual `trace <id>` path, and never past a bounded window.
- **Surface the limit, don't swallow it.** `ExecuteQueryWithContext` hands the
  Grail notifications back on the response (`resp.GetNotifications()`) without
  printing them (its stderr hint path is CLI-only, never invoked by the TUI).
  `internal/tui/notice.go` classifies them (scan limit / result limit / fetch
  timeout / sampling — mirroring exec's unexported `classifyNotification`) and
  the app shows a one-line footer banner. A scan-limit or timeout notice on an
  *empty* result also suppresses the widen retry — that empty is "the scan gave
  up," not "the trace isn't in this window."
- Notification type is `SCAN_LIMIT_GBYTES`; some deployments don't stamp a
  stable type, so the message-text fallback ("stopped after N gigabytes of data
  were scanned") is a second signal. Other levers exist (`bucket:{…}`,
  `samplingRatio`, raising `--default-scan-limit-gbytes`) but narrowing the
  timeframe is the biggest and the only one dtui applies automatically.

### 1.12 The expansion tables (RUM, bizevents, dictionary, dt.system, synthetic)

Validated live for Phase 3.5 (box tenant; synthetic on the demo tenant):

- **`user.events` has NO `event.type`** — `summarize by:{event.type}`
  returns one null bucket, silently. The discriminator is
  `characteristics.classifier` (request, error, user_action, view_summary,
  page_summary, navigation, …), and the field set varies per classifier.
  Durations and web vitals are **ns strings** (`"1948000000"` = 1948ms) but
  `web_vitals.cumulative_layout_shift` and `ttfb.*_duration` are raw floats.
- **`user.sessions` is sparse** (single digits over 2h) — the view floors
  its window at 24h (same pattern as vulnerabilities). The session↔events
  join key is `dt.rum.session.id` on both tables, `-0` suffix included.
  `dt.smartscape.frontend` / `frontend.name` are **scalars on events but
  arrays on sessions** — the sessions scope filter goes through
  `matchesPhrase(arrayToString(…))`, the events one through
  `== toSmartscapeId(…)`.
- **`bizevents` payloads are producer-shaped**: one producer writes flat
  `slo_name`, another dotted `slo.name`, a third only `event.category` —
  and `event.category` can be entirely absent. A content column is a
  client-side coalesce chain; `event.type` + `event.provider` are the
  reliable facets. Window floored at 24h (2h hid all but one producer).
- **`dt.semantic_dictionary.fields.model_id` is null on all ~1400 records**
  — a dead column. The real join is reversed: `models.fields` is a string
  array; `expand fields | join [fetch …fields], kind: leftOuter, on: {
  left[field_name] == right[name] }`. Default (inner) join silently drops
  the ~13% of declared names without a definition row. No model is named
  `spans`/`logs` — the Grail table lives in `data_object`, and five
  link-models carry the **literal string "null"** there.
- **`dt.system.data_objects`** distinguishes tables from views by `type`
  (19/344 on box); the `metrics` object is `usable_with:
  ["fieldsSnapshot"]` only — `fetch metrics` is invalid, so the tables
  view refuses enter there. **`dt.system.buckets`** is snake_case
  (`retention_days`, `dt.bucket.class`, `dt.system.table`) and has no
  status column (REST-only). **`load` syntax**: double quotes, absolute
  path, no scheme — wrong shapes fail loud (PARSE_ERROR_SINGLE_QUOTES /
  TABULAR_FILE_MUST_START_WITH_SLASH / UNKNOWN_TABULAR_FILE), and both
  `| search` and facet filters compose after `load` fine.
- **Synthetic *monitors* are not in Smartscape.** `smartscapeNodes
  "SYNTHETIC_TEST"` / `"SYNTHETIC_MONITOR"` is empty even on tenants with dozens
  of monitors — but *(validated OneAgent/OTel-demo tenants)* the synthetic *infrastructure* nodes
  `SYNTHETIC_LOCATION` and `SYNTHETIC_ENGINE` **do** appear, so a blanket
  `smartscapeNodes "SYNTHETIC_*"` is **not** empty. The views run on classic
  `fetch dt.entity.synthetic_test` / `dt.entity.http_check` (which are absent
  entirely on some tenants — `UNKNOWN_DATA_OBJECT` on OTel-demo tenant; present on OneAgent-fed tenant)
  (union via
  `append [ … ]` — validated) with `fieldsAdd lifetime, tags` (unknown
  attributes there **hard-fail** with FIELD_DOES_NOT_EXIST, unlike most of
  Grail). Two metric families keyed by different entity dims
  (`dt.synthetic.browser.*` by `dt.entity.synthetic_test`,
  `dt.synthetic.http.*` by `dt.entity.http_check`) — the availability
  enrichment appends two timeseries and aliases both dims to one `key`
  field. Classic entity ids are plain strings: `in(dim, {"ID"})` without
  `toSmartscapeId`. Execution results: `fetch dt.synthetic.events` (exact
  name), HTTP step events are `http_step_execution` (no "monitor").
- **LogPatternExtractor** (`dt.statistics.clustering.LogPatternExtractor`):
  input `{"logQuery": …}` — the query **must project `timestamp` and
  `content`** (schema-enforced) — plus `numberOfExamples` and
  `generalParameters.timeframe`. The generic `--query` shorthand of
  `dtctl exec analyzer` maps to `timeSeriesData` and is wrong for this
  analyzer. Execution is effectively synchronous (<1s for hundreds of
  records; the SDK's ExecuteAndWait covers the async path). Output items
  `{patternExpression, sampleMatches, numberOfMatches}` arrive **unsorted**
  — sort client-side. The pattern drops straight into
  `| filter matchesPattern(content, "<pattern>")` (validated live; invalid
  patterns fail loud with ERROR_IN_PARSING_PATTERN, a rare non-silent DQL
  error).

### 1.12b Resource attributes vs record payload (dictionary source of truth)

The semantic dictionary partitions attributes into **resource** context (what
emitted the signal — host, k8s, cloud, language runtime) and **record payload**
(the event's own data — a log's content/loglevel, a span's http/db/exception),
and the record inspector uses this to order namespace groups (payload above
resource above `dt.*` plumbing). Facts, validated live (OneAgent-fed tenant) and against the
public [Dynatrace semantic dictionary](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/semantic-dictionary):

- **The split is first-class in the dictionary but invisible in Grail.** The
  dictionary distinguishes resource attributes from signal attributes.
  **Grail records do not carry this marker** — OTLP resource attributes arrive as plain fields, so a custom
  or non-well-known resource attribute is indistinguishable from payload at
  query time. Any classification must therefore be a *heuristic over field
  names*, degrading safely (unknown → treat as payload, never hide/label).
- **Classification is per-group, not per-top-namespace.** A dozen first-dot
  tokens straddle both sides — most importantly `http.*` (`http.server_name` is
  resource, but `http.request.method` / `http.response.status_code` are span
  payload). Others: `dt`, `os_service`, `device`, `browser`, `cics`, `zos`,
  `aws`, `azure`, `cloud`, `faas`, `process`. Resolve by dominant use.
- **We bake a static allowlist, no runtime dictionary dependency.** The
  resource-namespace set lives in `catalog.ResourceNamespace`
  (`internal/tui/catalog/namespaces.go`), derived once from the dictionary's resource attributes
  (OTel-resource-convention aligned, so it tracks OTel for free).
  Straddlers included as resource: `aws azure cloud faas process device browser
  os_service`; excluded (stay payload): `http` (signal-dominant), `dt` (its own
  plumbing tier), `cics`/`zos` (niche + mixed).
- **It is an implicit ordering hint only** — never a UI label or section, never
  an API surface. See `groupRank` in `internal/tui/inspector.go`. Because the
  marker is absent in Grail, a labeled "resource attributes" section would lie
  on any misfiled OTLP attr; reordering silently does not.

### 1.13 API-backed table views (Spec.API)

Views without a DQL substrate (SLOs, anomaly detectors) or with a non-DQL
execution engine (log patterns) set `Spec.API` to a source name; sources are
`func(ctx, scope, dql)` closures built in `sources.go` from the
existing resource handlers and injected via `tui.Options.Sources` — `internal/tui`
stays HTTP-free. Rules learned:

- The composed `Spec.Query` output (when present) is handed to the source as
  input — the patterns source analyzes it, so `/`-searches and facets keep
  working on an analyzer-backed view. Sources that ignore the dql (slos)
  must have `Query == nil`, which makes the table view refuse server
  searches and facets **with a status message** instead of showing narrowing
  pills that silently did nothing.
- `Spec.Echo` supplies the command echo (`dtctl get slos`) since there is no
  query to render. `CanScope` is false by construction when `Query == nil`.
- The SLO API returns definitions only — no status/value/error budget. The
  slos source runs the evaluation endpoint per SLO (parallel, bounded,
  ~12s cap) and merges the first criteria's result; evaluation failures
  degrade to blank cells, never errors.
- The drill into patterns is view-level, not row-level: 'a' needs no
  selection and inherits the view's FULL scope (entity, trace, pattern)
  **and** its server searches/facets (`pushViewMsg.searches/.facets`) —
  patterns describe the list you are looking at. ('g' was unavailable: it
  is go-to-top.)
- **Projection order matters for injected facets.** The analyzer's schema
  demands the logQuery project `timestamp` and `content` — but a
  `| fields` stage inside `Spec.Query` sits BEFORE the facet stages
  `InjectStages` adds at the tail, so every inherited facet would filter a
  projected-away (null) field and feed the analyzer zero records (found in
  review). The projection is therefore appended by the source, after
  composition (`catalog.LogPatternInput`); a trailing
  `… | filter loglevel == "ERROR" | limit 300 | fields
  timestamp, content` validates live (SUCCESSFUL).
- Interactive facets stay disabled on API views even when they carry a
  Query: the fetched records (patterns) are not the query's rows (logs),
  so a record-attribute facet would inject a filter on a field the
  pipeline never carries. Facets *inherited from the source list* apply
  fine — they came from that pipeline.

### 1.13b Documents (dashboards) & IAM user resolution

The `dashboards` view is document-API-backed (`dashboardSource`,
`document.Handler.List` with `DocumentFilters{Type:"dashboard"}` — the same
call `dtctl get dashboards` makes). Facts learned building it:

- **The document API drops trailing metadata unless you ask.** `labels` (the
  UI's dashboard *tags*), `shareInfo.isShared`, `originExtensionId`,
  `userContext.lastAccessedTime` are all omitted from list responses unless
  named in `DocumentFilters.AddFields` — a *silent* omission (no error, the
  field is just absent), the document-API cousin of the Grail
  empty-result trap. `dashboardSource` requests `labels, shareInfo.isShared`.
  Only these two add-field keys are tenant-validated; `userContext.*` is a
  guess and a bad add-field key would error the whole call, so it is not sent.
- **`ConvertToDocuments` is lossy — read `list.Documents` (the metadata)
  directly.** The CLI `Document` read model drops the per-user `Access` levels
  the API returns, so the source iterates the raw `DocumentMetadata`.
- **A document `owner` is a user UUID, not a name.** There is no DQL path to
  resolve it (no `dt.system.users`; `NamesQuery`/Smartscape covers entity ids
  only). The route is the IAM REST handler (`iam.Handler.ListUsers`, filter by
  `uuid`, batchable) — wired as the `resolve-users` source and called from the
  inspector's `resolveOwners`. Resolution is **detail-view only** (the list and
  preview keep the raw id) and scoped to `type=="dashboard"` records via
  `catalog.DashboardUserIDs`.
- **IAM often 403s on an environment token.** `ListUsers` hits
  `/platform/iam/v1/organizational-levels/environment/{envID}/users`, which
  needs account-level scope (`iam:users:read`) a plain tenant token frequently
  lacks. The inspector surfaces the failure on the status line (silent would
  look like a dead feature) and clears its request latch so `r` retries.
- Sort documents by the `modificationInfo.lastModifiedTime` **instant**, not
  the formatted RFC3339 string — non-UTC offsets sort lexically wrong.
- **`DocumentFilters.ChunkSize==0` returns the first page only (~20), not
  everything.** The handler paginates through `nextPageKey` *only* when
  `ChunkSize>0`; at 0 it returns the first page and stops — so a tenant with
  hundreds of dashboards silently shows ~20 (the API's default page size). This
  is the pagination cousin of the add-fields silent-omission trap. `dtctl`'s
  `--chunk-size` defaults to 500 for the same reason; `dashboardSource` sets
  `ChunkSize: 500` to match.
- **The default List (no `Owner`, no `admin-access`) returns what the *token*
  can access — owned + shared-with-me — not the whole tenant.** The three
  document-list scopes are: default = accessible; `DocumentFilters.Owner==me` =
  strictly owned; `AdminAccess:true` = every tenant document (needs
  `document:documents:admin`). The dashboards view exposes the first two as the
  `all`/`mine` lenses (an API view, so it keys the server-side owner slice off
  `Scope.Lens`, not a DQL `Lens.Filter`), echoing `dtctl get dashboards
  [--mine]`. "me" is `session.Client.CurrentUserID()` (`/platform/metadata/v1/user`,
  JWT-subject fallback) — same UUID space as a document's `owner`. It needs the
  `app-engine:apps:run` scope and can't resolve on a platform token; the `mine`
  lens surfaces that failure rather than silently listing everything, and the id
  is memoized on success only so a later switch retries. `admin-access` is left
  out — it 403s without admin scope for most tokens.

### 1.14 GenAI spans — prompts, tool calls, and the dot namespace

Validated live (box tenant, agent workloads):

- **`gen_ai.operation.name`** discriminates `chat`, `execute_tool`, and
  `invoke_agent` (semconv also defines `embeddings`/`text_completion`).
- **Chat spans carry the whole exchange**: `gen_ai.input.messages`,
  `gen_ai.output.messages`, and `gen_ai.system_instructions` are JSON
  *strings* of `[{role, parts}]`; part types seen live: `text`,
  `reasoning`, `tool_call` (`{id, name, arguments}`), and
  `tool_call_response`. Roles: user / assistant / tool. Parse cost is real
  (100 KB+ prompts) — per-row derivations must memoize (the genai lens
  caches under a `__genai.*` record key; column Value funcs run every
  render frame).
- **Tool spans**: `gen_ai.tool.name` / `gen_ai.tool.call.arguments` /
  `gen_ai.tool.call.result`. **Agent spans**: `gen_ai.agent.name`,
  `gen_ai.conversation.id`.
- **Token usage**: `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` / `.output_tokens` plus
  `gen_ai.usage.cache_read.input_tokens` / `.cache_creation.input_tokens`
  — cache reads dwarf fresh input on agent workloads (fold them into the
  "in" figure or it looks absurdly small).
- **The Smartscape linkage breaks the lowercased-type rule**: GENAI_MODEL
  entities stamp spans as `dt.smartscape.gen_ai.model` (likewise
  `.provider`, `.service`, `.agent`) — a dot namespace, NOT
  `dt.smartscape.genai_model`. `smartscapeField()` special-cases the
  `GENAI_` prefix and `SpanScopable` includes it. The ids appear on spans
  even when `smartscapeNodes "GENAI_*"` returns no nodes (observed live).
  *(Not reproducible on OneAgent/OTel-demo tenants:* both `dt.smartscape.gen_ai.model` and the
  wrong `dt.smartscape.genai_model` returned zero even on GenAI-span subsets —
  neither tenant has populated GenAI Smartscape topology, so the dot-namespace
  spelling remains validated only on the original tenant.)
- **A second convention exists and dominates some tenants** (demo's
  LangChain/Azure agents): NO `gen_ai.operation.name` — the discriminator
  is `llm.request.type` (chat/completion/embeddings) — and the exchange
  lives in flat numbered attributes: `gen_ai.prompt.N.role/.content`,
  `gen_ai.prompt.N.tool_calls.M.name/.arguments`,
  `gen_ai.completion.N.*`, with cache tokens under
  `gen_ai.usage.cache_read_input_tokens` (underscore, not
  `.cache_read.input_tokens`). The genai lens filter ORs both
  discriminators; `GenAIInput/GenAIOutput` parse either shape into the
  same message model (`FlatGenAIMessages`). These spans still carry the
  `dt.smartscape.gen_ai.*` ids.
- **GenAI spans rarely include trace roots** — a GENAI-scoped traces view
  on the default roots lens is silently empty (found live: 225 matching
  spans, 0 roots). `DefaultSpanLens` opens GENAI drills/tabs on the genai
  lens instead.

### 1.15 The session timeline (RUM waterfall)

- One busy session held **16k request events vs 65 user actions / 61 view
  summaries / 76 errors** — a session timeline must default to the journey
  skeleton (`view_summary`, `user_action`, `navigation`, `error`) and keep
  requests one lens away, or the story drowns in XHR noise.
- **Nesting is time containment, not ids**: `dt.rum.view.id` and
  `user_action.id` were null on the probe tenant. A `view_summary`'s
  `start_time` is the view's *start* (its window spans the whole view), so
  sorting `start_time asc` and nesting each event under the latest
  view/action window that contains its start emits parents directly
  before their children (`catalog.BuildSessionTimeline`).
- **`trace.id` on request events is a plain 32-hex string** (nullable) —
  it drops straight into the trace waterfall. That one field is the whole
  frontend→backend bridge.

### 1.15b RUM browser-side ids (Chrome deep-link extraction)

Validated against the live astroshop demo site
(the Chrome-extension deep-link spike, `docs/design/WEB_DEEPLINK.md`):

- **The RUM generation decides the whole shape.** The astroshop demo is **Gen2 RUM**:
  sessions/events live in `fetch user.sessions` / `fetch user.events`
  (§1.12), keyed by `dt.rum.session.id` (format `<32 A-Z>-0`). There is **no
  `bhv.*` / `fetch events` RUM data** here — that `bhv.name` / `characteristics.has_*`
  world is **Gen3** (what internal Gen3-only
  tooling parses). A deep-link rule's field + data object must match the target
  tenant's generation; there is no single portable RUM field across both.
- **The browser hands you the session id in the beacon URL, not a cookie or a
  JS API.** The RUM agent posts its beacon to `<app-origin>/rb_...?...&vi=<SESSION_ID>&...`
  and that **`vi` query param is exactly `dt.rum.session.id`** (confirmed:
  `vi=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-0` returned that session's events in
  Grail). This is why the extension's RUM source is `source:"request"`
  (`webRequest.onBeforeRequest`, URL only — no body, no snappy). `window.dtrum`
  exposes **no** session-id getter (checked its full prototype); the `dtCookie`
  `sn_` value is a *different* hex id (the visit's server-side number), and
  `dtPC` also carries the `vi` but the beacon URL is the clean surface.
- **The browser-exposed trace id does NOT resolve to backend spans here.**
  astroshop responses carry `server-timing: dtTrId;desc="<32-hex>"` and requests
  a matching W3C `traceparent: 00-<same 32-hex>-…`, but that trace id returned
  **0 rows** from `fetch spans` while the backend services' own spans carry
  *different* `trace.id`s (dual OTel+OneAgent instrumentation, uncorrelated
  trace ids). So a `trace` deep link off the browser header would **silently**
  open an empty waterfall (the §1.11c / silent-empty trap) — the astroshop
  example bundle deliberately ships no trace action. (Contrast §1.15: the
  `trace.id` *field on a RUM request event in Grail* is the reliable bridge; the
  *browser-header* trace id is not, on this deployment.)
- The beacon-URL `tracestate` also embeds the RUM app id + `rxVisitor` + `vi`
  (`…;0123456789abcdef;<rxVisitor>;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-0;1`), but
  the `vi` query param is the simplest extraction point.

### 1.16 Log-pattern expressions carry named exports

`LogPatternExtractor` names every variable matcher in its
`patternExpression` — `'LISTEN ' DQS:f_1`, `'SELECT ' DATA:f_1` — so the
same expression works as **both** the `matchesPattern(content, P)`
predicate and a `| parse content, P` stage (validated live: `f_1` comes
back as a real field, DQS with the quotes already stripped). Detecting
exports requires stripping single-quoted literals first — a literal
`'FOO:bar'` is not an export (`catalog.PatternExports`). Pure-literal
patterns extract nothing and keep the standard log columns. Search
injection stays legal (it lands before the parse stage) and facet filters
compose after it, so parsed fields are facetable.

### 1.17 OAuth expiry in a long-running TUI

The executor's `OnUnauthorized` hook only guarded the **poll loop** — the
initial `query:execute` had no 401 handling, so a TUI idling past the
access token's lifetime failed its next query with "JWT token expired".
The fix sits one layer down, in `pkg/client`: a resty retry condition
that, on 401, re-resolves the token through the OAuth manager (forcing a
refresh when the local cache still looks valid — clock skew, compact
keyring storage), swaps it in, and retries once. Unchanged tokens (static
API tokens, dead credentials) surface the original 401 with no retry, and
a token refreshed seconds ago that is rejected again stops the loop.
Every consumer of the shared resty client — DQL execute + poll, the SLO
evaluation fan-out, Settings, the analyzer — inherits the fix
(`Client.EnableTokenRefresh`, wired in `NewFromConfig`).

### 1.18 The edge fleet — OneAgents, ActiveGates, and FLEET_EVENT

The observability edge is itself queryable *(validated OneAgent-fed tenant)*:

- **`smartscapeNodes "ONEAGENT"`** — one node per agent. Thin: `name` (=host
  name), `dt.agent.module.version`, `dt.agent.monitoring_mode` (`FULL_STACK` /
  `INFRASTRUCTURE` / `DISCOVERY`), `dt.network_zone.id`, `k8s.cluster.name`,
  `lifetime`. Node id `ONEAGENT-<hex>`.
- **`smartscapeNodes "ACTIVEGATE"`** — richer, but field families are
  **duplicated** across schema eras: prefer `dt.active_gate.version` /
  `dt.active_gate.group.name` and fall back to the older `version` /
  `dt.activegate_group` (some records carry only one set). Also `purpose`,
  `modules[]` (`METRICS_INGEST`, `AGENT_ROUTING`, `KUBERNETES`, …), `os.*`,
  `is_containerized`, `is_fips`, `ip[]`. Node id `ACTIVEGATE-<hex>`.
- Both types are auto-derived by `smartscapeField` (→ `dt.smartscape.oneagent`
  / `dt.smartscape.activegate`), so `SignalFilter` scopes them with no special
  case; neither has a `legacyField`.

**FLEET_EVENT** (`fetch events | filter event.kind == "FLEET_EVENT"`) is the
per-agent state stream. Two `event.type`s seen:

- **`ONEAGENT_METADATA`** (the bulk — ~195k rows / 2h) — a **per-module
  heartbeat** at **~5min cadence** (validated OneAgent-fed tenant: one agent's 7 modules emitted
  14 rows in 10min), so counting raw rows overcounts modules; dedup by
  `{dt.smartscape.oneagent, dt.agent.module.id}`. Carries
  `dt.agent.module.{name,type,version,health,injection_mode,first_seen}`,
  `dt.agent.installer_version` (the authoritative full-agent version),
  `dt.agent.monitoring_mode`, `dt.agent.live_debugger.enabled`, `os.*`,
  `dt.process_group.id`, `k8s.namespace.name`, `host.name`, `dt.host_group.id`,
  `aws.*`, and the join keys `dt.smartscape.{oneagent,host,process}` +
  `dt.smartscape.activegate` (the AG the agent routes through). Health word is
  `Healthy` (not in `ClassLevel`'s map — needs its own class func).
  `dt.agent.module.id` is a **`uid`**, not a string: a plain-string `==` /
  `in()` compare silently returns empty (§1.2) — group by it, don't string-match
  it.
- **`ACTIVEGATE_ONLINE`** — sparse online notices: `event.name`,
  `event.severity` (`INFO`), `dt.active_gate.id`, `dt.smartscape.activegate`.

**Latest-state, NOT `sort timestamp desc | takeFirst`.** The obvious "dedup to
newest emission" form (`sort timestamp desc | summarize {…=takeFirst(…)}`)
forces Grail to order the whole scanned window and **blows the 10s scan limit on
a busy tenant** — validated OneAgent-fed tenant: a *scoped* 30m sort+takeFirst timed out
incomplete. Instead **stream**: `summarize { seen = takeMax(timestamp), … =
takeAny(…) }, by:{…}` — no global sort. Over a short window the descriptive
fields (`health`, `version`, …) are stable across the ~5min heartbeat, so an
arbitrary in-window sample (`takeAny`) is the module's current value;
`takeMax(timestamp)` tracks freshness. This turned the fleet-wide dedup from a
timeout into **~100ms over 1.2M records** (8k+ modules / 2.3k agents).

The fleet view (`fleet.go`) uses this three ways, all window-**capped at 30m**
(`fleetStateWindow`; ~6 heartbeats — every live module appears — and the scan
stays a few M records) because `fetch events` scans the whole window regardless
of the downstream summarize (§1.11c) — these are latest-state lookups, not
history:

- **oneagents lens** — folds the deduped per-agent module rollup onto the
  Smartscape list rows via the batched `Enrich`,
  `in(dt.smartscape.oneagent, {toSmartscapeId(…)})` (the id is a
  `smartscape_id`; a plain-string `in()` silently returns empty, §1.2).
- **modules lens + `:modules` view** — a deduplicated module inventory, one row
  per injected **module instance**. Grain facts validated live:
  `dt.agent.module.id` identifies one module *load*, tied to a process launch —
  it is **not** a stable logical-module id and **not** per-emission. A
  short-lived process relaunching yields many ids (each a distinct
  `startup_timestamp`); one process can carry **several modules at once**
  (`dt.smartscape.process` repeats across rows), so never collapse by process.
  The summarize keeps the **full event under its original field names**
  (`fleetModuleState`, backticked dotted aliases — DQL needs them for a dotted
  output name) so the record inspector groups the module's fields by namespace
  exactly like the raw event; a module is not a node, so this summarized record
  *is* its detail. Entering a module row therefore opens the **module detail
  page** (`newModuleDetailView`, routed by `Spec.Inspect` on the fleet + modules
  specs): its **first tab is that static record inspector** — no fetch-on-open,
  so navigating in never refetches the monitored process's Smartscape node and
  "flips" the screen — alongside the module's own **agent logs** (§1.19) and
  **events** tabs, both scoped to the monitored process. The process/host/agent
  are navigable links inside the record tab, and the row's `Entity` resolves to
  the process so those tabs, the 'v'/'l' drills, and Selection scope by it. The
  `modules` spec is registered top-level and wired as the `ONEAGENT` detail tab
  (`containmentTabs`), where the query composes the pinned agent's
  `dt.smartscape.oneagent` (or a host's `dt.smartscape.host`).
- **events `fleet` lens** — the raw ONEAGENT_METADATA stream (strictly that
  type; ACTIVEGATE_ONLINE is excluded — AG state lives on the node).

**Edge components are not workloads.** An edge component is **no metric
dimension** (validated OneAgent-fed tenant), so `IsEdgeComponent` drops the metrics detail tab
for both types. It carries no *workload* log records under the generic
`SignalFilter` either (the scoped logs query scanned 20GB to return zero —
agent logs carry no `dt.smartscape.oneagent`/`activegate` field), but it **does**
emit its own agent log files, surfaced through a dedicated logs tab (§1.19). The
`ONEAGENT` detail page is `details / modules / logs / events / problems /
related`; its **events tab opens on the `fleet` lens** (`DefaultEventLens`) so
the FLEET_EVENT stream renders with module columns rather than empty Davis
columns. An `ACTIVEGATE` carries its whole state on the node record, so its
detail page is `details / logs / problems / related`.

### 1.19 Agent logs — the OneAgent/ActiveGate self-logs (`agentLogsSpec`)

With **agent log monitoring** enabled (a per-tenant / per-host setting — OneAgent-fed tenant has
it, many tenants do not), Dynatrace ingests the edge components' **own** log
files. These are distinct from the application/infrastructure logs of the
processes a OneAgent injects into, and conflating the two is the trap to avoid.

**The anti-conflation key is the `log.source` path prefix `/var/log/dynatrace/`**
*(validated OneAgent-fed tenant)*. Every agent log file lives there; the only trees are
`oneagent/`, `gateway/`, `synthetic/`, `sc2/`. This prefix excludes both the
injected workloads' app logs (under the app's own paths) **and** other vendors'
agents that merely match the word "agent" (`/var/log/amazon/ssm/…`,
`/var/log/aws-routed-eni/network-policy-agent.log`). Never scope agent logs by a
`contains(log.source, "agent")` — it conflates all three.

Agent logs carry **no** `dt.smartscape.oneagent`/`dt.active_gate.id` field —
only the host/process that emitted them — so `SignalFilter(OneAgent)` matches
nothing. `agentLogFilter` composes the right scope per entity type instead:

- **OneAgent (combined, all modules)** — `dt.smartscape.host ==
  toSmartscapeId(HOST-<x>) and startsWith(log.source,
  "/var/log/dynatrace/oneagent/")`. The `ONEAGENT-<x>` id shares its hex suffix
  with the `HOST-<x>` it monitors *(validated OneAgent-fed tenant: 2319/2319 agents; every node
  also has a `monitors.host` reference)*, so the host id is a pure string
  rewrite of the agent id. Returned 41k lines / 10 module files for one host.
- **Module (per injected module)** — `dt.smartscape.host ==
  toSmartscapeId(HOST-<x>) and startsWith(log.source,
  "/var/log/dynatrace/oneagent/<subdir>/")`, where `<subdir>` is derived from
  `dt.agent.module.type` (`moduleLogDir`: `log_analytics`→`loganalytics`,
  `os`→`os`, `java`→`java`, `go`→`go`, `python`→`python`, `nginx`→`nginx`,
  `nodejs`→`nodejs`, `sdk`→`sdk`, `remote_plugin`→`plugin`). **Do NOT scope a
  module row by the process id it resolves to** — the earlier belief that a
  module's logs are stamped with the module's resolved `dt.smartscape.process`
  was **wrong** *(re-validated OneAgent-fed tenant 2026-07-16)*. A module's log files are stamped
  with the module's **own agent process** (e.g. PGI named "OneAgent log
  analytics"), a churny id that relaunches independently and only **~36%** of
  which match the process the `ONEAGENT_METADATA` snapshot carries (join over
  8846 metadata procs → 3143 in any oneagent log record). That id can even be a
  dead PGI that resolves to no entity. Net effect: process-scoped module log
  tabs were empty **most of the time** (the reported `oneagentloganalytics`
  bug), even though the logs exist and are voluminous (loganalytics is the OneAgent-fed tenant's
  highest-volume oneagent subdir). Host + subdir is the only stable join —
  neither the process id nor the process *group* joins the two sides. The
  trade-off: a host running several same-tech processes shows all of that tech's
  module logs on the host (one subdir), which is acceptable and beats empty.
  Still do **not** narrow by `dt.agent.module.name` in the filename — the module
  name and the log-file token diverge (module
  `Cassandra_cassandra-cluster_Cassandra_dev` → file `ruxitagent_Cassandra_dev-#`),
  so `contains(log.source, module.name)` silently returns empty (§1.2 trap). An
  unmapped `module.type` (e.g. `z`) leaves `ModuleLogDir` empty and falls back to
  the best-effort process filter — no worse than the old behavior.
- **ActiveGate** — `host.name == <node name> and startsWith(…/dynatrace/) and
  not startsWith(…/oneagent/)` (i.e. `gateway/` + `synthetic/` + `sc2/`). Gateway
  logs carry only the host running the AG (**never** `dt.active_gate.id`; the
  metadata `dt.smartscape.activegate` is the many-hosts *routes-through*
  relation, useless for locating the AG), so there is **no reliable node→host
  link**. Matching the AG node name to the log `host.name` resolves
  **standalone/dedicated ActiveGates** (node name == host name — validated OneAgent-fed tenant:
  1803 gateway lines for `ip-10-0-0-1.ec2.internal`); **containerized AGs**
  (pod name ≠ k8s-node host.name) have no handle and honestly show nothing.

`agentLogsSpec` is `KindSignal`; an unscopable entity collapses to `filter
false` (never a fleet-wide scan — agent logs, esp. `oneagent-logmon-detailed.log`,
are voluminous). It backs the `logs` detail tab for both edge types (kept under
the `logs` name so `l` still jumps to it), the `logs` tab on the **module detail
page** (§1.18, host + subdir-scoped), and the `l` drill on fleet node / module rows.

### 1.20 Log stream ordering & cap — head/tail is a re-fetch, `limit` is post-scan

The logs views (`logsSpec`, `agentLogsSpec`) share one sort+limit tail,
`catalog.LogTail(Scope)`, so the raw reader's controls are pure DQL, not client
state:

- **Head vs. tail is the `sort` direction, so it re-fetches.** Tail (the default)
  is `sort timestamp desc | limit N` — the newest N; head is `sort timestamp asc`
  — the oldest N. `K`/`J` client re-sort only reorders the *already-fetched* page,
  so it can never turn the newest N into the oldest N; the reader's `T` toggle
  flips `Scope.LogHead` and issues a new query. Both are timeframe-bounded — head
  is the oldest records *in the window*, not "the start of the file."
- **Raising the cap is cheap.** `Scope.Limit` (the reader's `+` steps 300 → 1000
  → 3000 → 10000) changes only `| limit N`, which is applied **after** the scan —
  the same principle as §1.11c (a `filter` narrows the *result*, not the *scan*).
  So "load more" grows the rows held and rendered, not the GB Grail reads; the
  scan cost is set by `from:`/`to:` and scope, which is why logs stay entity-gated
  regardless of cap. *(Consequence of §1.11c; not separately tenant-timed.)*

### 1.21 Primary Grail tags & the service metric-backed list

Validated on tenants demo tenant A (primary tags `app`/`env`/`version`) and demo tenant B
(`service_detection`). See `docs/design/primary-grail-tags.md` for the full design.

- **Primary tags are flat dotted fields `primary_tags.<key>` — one notation
  everywhere**, on signals (spans, logs, `dt.davis.events`) *and* on
  `smartscapeNodes` records. There is **no** `primary_tags` map: on demo tenant B,
  `` primary_tags[`service_detection`] == … `` matched 0 while flat
  `primary_tags.service_detection == …` matched 16 on `smartscapeNodes "PROCESS"`.
  `filter`, `fieldsSummary … topValues`, and `fields`/`fieldsKeep` all work on them.
- **Absent-key projection is null-safe — there is no `FIELD_DOES_NOT_EXIST` trap
  for `primary_tags.*`.** Re-verified on demo tenant A *and* demo tenant B, spans/logs/events:
  `| fields x = primary_tags.<absent>`, `| fieldsKeep …, primary_tags.<absent>`,
  and even `| fieldsKeep …, <totally-unknown-field>` all return rows with a null
  cell, no error. `FIELD_DOES_NOT_EXIST` is reserved for genuinely-unknown *schema*
  fields (`dt.system.bucket` on a non-bucket table §1.10, `dt.entity.*`), not
  nested field access. So column projection needs no signal-vs-node branching.
- **The record JSON key is flat: `"primary_tags.app": "value"`** (validated demo tenant A, raw
  `smartscapeNodes "PROCESS"` record) — *not* a nested `primary_tags:{app:…}` object. So a
  `Column.Text` map-lookup on the literal key `"primary_tags.app"` reads it directly.
- **Special-char keys: backtick the WHOLE path.** `` `primary_tags.cost-center` `` parses,
  is null-safe, and matches real values (validated demo tenant A: `` `primary_tags.app`=="demo-app" ``
  → 5, identical to bare). Segment-backticking `` primary_tags.`cost-center` `` is a
  **PARSE_ERROR** ("isn't allowed here"). `catalog.escapeField` (facets.go:131) already emits
  the correct form: `bareField` regex allows dots so `primary_tags.app` stays bare, while a
  hyphen/colon key falls through to whole-path backticks. So `escapeField("primary_tags."+key)`
  is correct for any customer key — no special helper.
- **`takeAny(primary_tags.<key>)` works in a `smartscapeNodes` summarize** (validated demo tenant A
  PROCESS `by:{id}`): the null-ignoring carry-through for projection-based node specs.
- **Which entities carry populated tags is customer/environment config, not a feature
  property — the mechanics above are tenant-agnostic (work on `HOST` and anything else).**
  The fields exist null-safe everywhere; populated only where enriched. Caveat on the
  validation tenants: demo tenant A (and demo tenant B, which currently points at the same environment) are
  **host-less k8s demos**, so they happen to show tags on `PROCESS`/`SERVICE` metrics/`spans`
  (~62%)/`dt.davis.events` and empty on `CONTAINER`/`K8S_POD`/`K8S_DEPLOYMENT`/`logs`. That is
  an artifact of those tenants — says nothing about hosts or other types elsewhere. Columns/
  facets render present-but-empty where unpopulated; tests should assert the column/facet
  *exists* + shows values on an enriched type, not hard-code which types are enriched.
  Cross-tenant evidence: on demo tenant B (distinct tenant, 6 real `HOST` nodes) `primary_tags.*` is
  **queryable + null-safe on `HOST`** (unpopulated there, no error) — so no host-specific path
  is needed — and demo tenant B **logs carry `service_detection` (~42%)** while demo tenant A logs carried
  none, and demo tenant B HOST/CONTAINER/SERVICE are null for it. Population varies by tenant *and*
  key; the mechanics don't.
- **Services carry no filterable node dimensions — use the four service metrics**
  (`dt.service.request.count`, `dt.service.faas_invoke.count`,
  `dt.service.messaging.process.count`, `dt.service.request.service_mesh.count`). The
  services list is the **`metrics` command collapsed one-row-per-service *server-side***:
  `... | summarize name=takeAny(dt.service.name), <K>=takeAny(primary_tags.<K>) …,
  by:{dt.smartscape.service}`. The `metrics` command scans series *descriptors*, not
  datapoints — **Scanned bytes: 0** on demo tenant A for the full collapse. `summarize` is the
  pushdown-friendly aggregation (Grail optimizes it; it reduced 54 series → 15 rows
  server-side); **`dedup` is worse** — a blocking full-materialization op that bypasses
  that optimization. `id == dt.smartscape.service` (validated demo tenant A).
- **Two-pass, keys discovered not enumerated.** Pass 1 scans the sampled series' field
  names (`discoverDims`-style) for the `primary_tags.` prefix → the service primary-tag
  keys. Pass 2 names *only* those keys + the identity dim in `takeAny`/`by:` and **drops
  every other dim by omission** (no maintained remove-list; exploding dims `endpoint.name`,
  `rpc.grpc.status_code`, `failed`, `k8s.*` never grouped). So keys are a *result* fed
  into the query at runtime, never hardcoded.
- **`takeAny` is null-ignoring — collapse to exactly one row per service.** A service's
  series are a mix of tagged and null-tagged; grouping *by* `primary_tags.*` fragments it
  (validated demo tenant A: 15 services → **19 rows**, one per service all-null). Aggregating the
  tags with `takeAny(primary_tags.<K>)` grouped by `dt.smartscape.service` only collapses
  to **exactly 15** and fills each tag from the non-null series (`orbit-ai`/`rpc-target`/
  `mock-llm` surfaced real `demo-app/demo/0.1.0`).
- **Name = `getNodeName(dt.smartscape.service)`, resolved post-collapse** — the canonical
  resolver per the `dt-dql-essentials`/`dt-obs-services` skills (a smartscape id renders as
  an id, not a name). Validated demo tenant A: matches `takeAny(dt.service.name)` on every service
  and doesn't depend on the `dt.service.name` dimension being present. Applied to the ~15
  collapsed rows (`| fieldsAdd name = getNodeName(...)`), so it's cheap.
- **Prefer the `metrics` command over `timeseries` for a discover-the-tags roster.** The
  services skill lists via `timeseries …, by:{…}`, but `timeseries` computes datapoints and
  needs every `by:` dim named (would enumerate tag keys up front). The `metrics` command
  returns series *descriptors* (all dims as fields, **0 datapoint bytes**), so tag keys are
  discovered not enumerated and the collapse reads nothing. RED sparklines still use
  `timeseries`/Enrich.
- **Facet/search `| filter` injects PRE-`summarize`** (on the raw series, narrowing which
  feed the collapse): validated demo tenant A `| filter primary_tags.app == "demo-app"` → 8 of
  15. Normal pipe injection ahead of the trailing `summarize` — no `timeseries filter:{}`
  argument seam, no client-side group-by. (A metric-union *can* be `join`ed to
  `smartscapeNodes` with `on:{ left[dt.smartscape.service] == right[id] }` — join equalities
  need `left[]`/`right[]` refs, bare `field == field` errors
  `JOIN_CONDITION_IN_EQUALITY_HAS_TO_BE_LEFT_OR_RIGHT` — but the chosen design needs neither.)
- **The service filter surface = the dimensions present on those four metrics** — a
  **subset** of DT's global field picker (on demo tenant A: `primary_tags.*`, `cloud.provider`,
  `aws.region`/`aws.account.id`, `azure.location`, `gcp.region`, `http.response.status_code`,
  `k8s.cluster.name`/`namespace.name`/`workload.name`/`workload.kind`). A field not on
  these metrics can't filter services (`gcp.project.id` is in DT's picker but not a
  service-metric dim; `isNotNull` of an absent dim returns 0 silently). Everything the
  picker shows actually filters.
- **`/` search on the services view** cannot emit `| search` (not usable on `metrics`).
  Emulate it as a `| filter (contains(<dim>, "term", caseSensitive:false) or …)` pipe over
  the scanned dims. Use **`contains`, not `matchesValue`/`matchesPhrase`** — per the
  authoritative DQL guide `matchesValue` is *array*-field-only (`dt.tags`) and `matchesPhrase`
  is token/phrase-only (`dem` misses `demo-app` → 0 on demo tenant A). `contains(dt.service.name,
  "rpc", caseSensitive:false) or contains(primary_tags.app, "rpc", …)` reproduced the search
  exactly on demo tenant A (→ rpc-probe, rpc-target) and gives the substring/case-insensitive
  semantics the tool's `search "*term*"` wrap relies on (§1.10). (`matchesValue` on a scalar
  *happened* to work on demo tenant A, but it's unsupported for scalars — don't rely on it.)

#### 1.21.1 Services list — revised to the production services-app shape (validated demo tenant A 2026-07)

The dtctl services list was reworked to **mirror the shape of the Dynatrace services app** (whose
query any user can inspect via the app's own "open in notebook"). This **supersedes** the `metrics`-command bullets above (the `metrics | summarize
takeAny(...)` collapse, "prefer `metrics` over `timeseries`", "no `timeseries filter:{}` seam", and
"`| filter` PRE-`summarize`"). The primary-tag *field* mechanics above (flat dotted key, null-safe,
backticking, JSON key shape) are unchanged. Discovery (pass 1) is unchanged: `metrics from:<tf> |
filter in(metric.key,{4}) | limit 200`, scan record keys for dims + `primary_tags.*` (validated demo tenant A
returns `app/env/environment/version`, `service.name`, `dt.service.name`, `k8s.*`, `cloud.provider`,
`aws.*`, `azure.location`, `gcp.region`, `http.*`, `rpc.*`, `telemetry.sdk.language`).

The **list query is one `timeseries` roster joined to `smartscapeNodes`** (validated demo tenant A, one row
per service):

```
timeseries { req=sum(dt.service.request.count, scalar:true), faas=…, msg=…, mesh=… },
  union: true,
  by: { dt.smartscape.service, dt.service.name, service.name, `primary_tags.<k>`, … },
  filter: { isNotNull(dt.smartscape.service) [ AND <conds> ] }
| summarize { dt.service.name=takeLast(dt.service.name), service.name=takeLast(service.name),
    `primary_tags.<k>`=arrayToString(arrayRemoveNulls(collectDistinct(`primary_tags.<k>`)), delimiter:", ") },
    by:{ dt.smartscape.service }
| lookup [ smartscapeNodes "SERVICE" | fields id, name, lifetime, dt.service_detection.version ],
    sourceField: dt.smartscape.service, lookupField: id, fields:{ name, lifetime, dt.service_detection.version }
| fieldsAdd id=dt.smartscape.service, name=coalesce(name, dt.service.name, service.name, getNodeName(dt.smartscape.service))
| fieldsRemove req, faas, msg, mesh | sort name asc | limit 500
```

- **`scalar:true` + `union:true`** = a cheap one-value-per-series roster over the 4 metrics; unioned
  so any-of-4 reporting services appear (timeframe-dependent list, by design).
- **`filter:{}` (the timeseries argument) narrows PRE-aggregation and CAN reference fields not in
  `by:`** — validated demo tenant A: `k8s.workload.kind == "deployment"` (not in `by:`) → 16 rows; the
  services app filters `matchesValue(primary_tags.team,"broker")` likewise. So **every discovered
  dim is filterable** via `filter:{}` regardless of `by:`; only `by:`+`summarize`/lookup fields
  survive into the row (columns/peek). Filter surface and display surface are decoupled.
- **Dotted backtick summarize alias `` `primary_tags.app` = arrayToString(arrayRemoveNulls(
  collectDistinct(...))) `` parses and populates**; the record key is flat `"primary_tags.app"`.
  `takeAny` (null-ignoring) is the aggregation for primary-tag keys — they are ownership metadata,
  consistent across a service's series; a series lacking the tag simply contributes null which
  `takeAny` skips. The result is null for a service with no tag value on any series → peek/inspector
  skip it. `collectDistinct+arrayToString` would also work but is unnecessarily complex here.
- **`lookup [ smartscapeNodes "SERVICE" … ], sourceField:dt.smartscape.service, lookupField:id`
  works** and brings `name`/`lifetime`/`dt.service_detection.version` in the same query — no
  join-equality `left[]==right[]` needed (that's for `join`; `lookup` uses source/lookupField). This
  is the "one query for the list + peek + SEEN" the design's separate-enrich note (above) avoided;
  the lookup is the validated, simpler path.
- **Value picker** = `metrics from:<tf> | filter in(metric.key,{4}) | fieldsSummary <dim>,
  topValues:250` (validated demo tenant A: `primary_tags.app` → demo-app 124 / demo-app-2 6 / null 88 —
  the null bucket is dropped by `ParseFieldsSummary`).
- **`filterSegments` DOES scope a `timeseries` roster**: demo tenant A unscoped 19
  services → `-S 0123456789A?k8s.namespace.name=demo-app` → 16.
- **Not exercised:** `getNodeName` fallback for a metric-only service with no smartscape node (none on
  demo tenant A; `lookup.name` was non-null for all) — low-risk residual.
- **`filter:{}` boolean composition (validated demo tenant A):** compound facet legs (`a == x or a == "x"`)
  must be **parenthesized** when ANDed into `filter:{ isNotNull(...) AND (…) }` — else the `or`
  mis-binds. `matchesValue(dim, "*api*")` works in `filter:{}`.
- **`contains` on a non-string dim is silent-empty, not an error.** `filter:{ … AND
  contains(http.response.status_code, "20") }` → `{"records":[]}` (exit 0) on demo tenant A; wrapping
  `contains(toString(http.response.status_code), "20")` → real rows. So the services `/` search
  contains-chain must `toString()` every dim (a rare deliberate `toString()` — §1.10 avoids it on
  facet fields for index reasons, but here correctness over a descriptor scan wins).

### 1.22 K8s labels/annotations live in `tags:` maps, faceted by map-key index

Validated live on a k8s scale tenant (~50k `K8S_POD` nodes), via `dtctl query`.

> **Current mechanism is §1.4b** (`Facet.MapField/MapKey` + tag discovery). The
> `Spec.FacetMaps` + projected-`labels`-alias plumbing this section originally
> described is **historical** — that field no longer exists. Everything else
> below (manifest-strip trap, backtick-every-key rule, which lists carry the
> maps, `FacetPriority`/tail ordering) is still accurate and still cited by
> live code; the two mechanism bullets are flagged inline.

- **Labels/annotations are NOT in the parsed manifest — they are stripped.**
  `| parse k8s.object, "JSON:obj"` then `obj[metadata][labels]` / `[annotations]`
  is **silent-empty** (type `undefined`, absent from every record) — the classic
  §1.4 trap. `obj[metadata]` carries only `name`/`namespace`/`uid`/`ownerReferences`/…
  The smartscape manifest omits the label/annotation blocks.
- **They live in the tag maps `` `tags:k8s.labels` `` and `` `tags:k8s.annotations` ``**
  (record/map type, backtick-quoted for the colon — same field family the nodes
  spec already reads for `instance`/`zone`, `k8s.go`). Populated on all pods on the
  scale tenant. This is the same source dtctl/UI use for node labels (§1.1-adjacent).
- **Faceting an arbitrary label/annotation KEY** *(historical mechanism —
  superseded by §1.4b, which filters `` `tags:*`[`key`] `` off the raw row via
  a stripped pipeline instead of projecting an alias)*: project the map through
  the summarize, then index it post-summarize. Full round-trip validated on
  `smartscapeNodes "K8S_POD"`:
  - Project: `` labels = takeFirst(`tags:k8s.labels`) `` inside the pod
    `| summarize {…}, by:{id}` — survives as a map field.
  - Value picker: `` | fieldsSummary labels[`app.kubernetes.io/name`], topValues:N ``
    returns top values post-summarize (null bucket dropped by `ParseFieldsSummary`).
  - Applied facet: `` | filter labels[`app.kubernetes.io/name`] == "oneagent" ``
    narrows correctly (post-summarize, before the sort/limit tail per §1.10).
- **Map-key references need the KEY backtick-quoted, always.** `` labels[`tier`] ``
  and `` labels[`app.kubernetes.io/name`] `` both work; a bare dotted key
  (`labels[app.kubernetes.io/name]`) would mis-read the dots as nested access.
  `catalog.escapeField` was extended to recognize a `base[key]` map-index ref and
  emit `` base[`key`] `` (base bare/backticked per its own chars, every key
  backtick-quoted) — distinct from the whole-path backticking it does for
  `tags:…`/`primary_tags.cost-center`. Values reuse `Facet.Stage`'s type-shaped
  legs unchanged (a `"38"` pod-template-generation value gets the integer legs).
- **The facet picker discovers keys, never enumerates them (§1.10 spirit).**
  *(Historical plumbing — `Spec.FacetMaps` is gone; discovery now runs off the
  tag census feeding `Facet.MapField/MapKey`, §1.4b.)* The old form:
  `facetCandidates` explodes a `map[string]any` record field named in
  `Spec.FacetMaps` into `field[key]` candidates from the keys present in the
  fetched sample; the typed-field escape hatch still reaches keys outside the
  sample. Either way no label/annotation key is hardcoded — arbitrary customer
  keys are reachable via the existing `f` picker.
- **Which k8s lists carry the tags (validated live, per-type `countIf(isNotNull)`):**
  `K8S_POD`, `K8S_DEPLOYMENT`/`STATEFULSET`/`DAEMONSET` (workloads), `K8S_NAMESPACE`,
  and `K8S_NODE` are 100% populated; **`K8S_CLUSTER` carries none** (0/1). So the
  pods/workloads/namespaces/nodes specs project the maps (for the peek + tag
  discovery, §1.4b); clusters do not. Two projection shapes, both
  round-trip-validated:
  `takeFirst(`tags:k8s.labels`)` inside the pods `summarize`, and bare
  `labels =`tags:k8s.labels`` in the `| fields` projection the other three use
  (the tag map is a direct field — no `| parse k8s.object` needed for it).
- **De-noising the picker — `Spec.FacetPriority` + a map-key tail.** Exploding
  labels/annotations floods the candidate list, so `facetCandidates` orders it:
  bucket field → `FacetPriority` (preselected dims present in the sample, in
  order) → alphabetical scalars → the map-key tail (grouped by `FacetMaps`
  position, so labels precede annotations). The picker draws a
  `labels / annotations` divider before the tail. **Keep `FacetPriority`
  scalar-only** — pinning a map key there strands it in the curated block above
  the plain scalars and mislabels the divider (the divider marks the *discovered*
  key tail, so it skips any priority-pinned map key). Curated per k8s spec (pods
  pin namespace/phase/node/workload/kind; workloads namespace/kind/type; nodes
  instance/zone/cluster; namespaces cluster).

### 1.23 GenAI/agent apps carry business ids as gen_ai span attributes

Validated live on a Gen3 tenant via `dtctl query` (7d window), in support of the
web-page deep-link feature (`docs/design/WEB_DEEPLINK.md`). The tenant-specific
field names below belong in the app's own imported rule bundle, not in this
repo — the pattern is what generalizes.

- An agent app emits OTel gen_ai spans into the `spans` table stamped with its
  business ids as **span attributes**, not entity properties — e.g.
  `<app>.session_id`, `<app>.task_id`, `<app>.conversation_id` (alongside the
  standard `gen_ai.conversation.id`, `gen_ai.agent.id/name`,
  `gen_ai.operation.name` = invoke_agent | execute_tool).
- Such attribute filters return **non-empty** under
  `fetch spans, from:… | filter <field> == "<id>"` (confirmed against real ids —
  the field names are real, not the silent-empty trap). These are plain
  attribute filters (a scan, so keep the timeframe bounded).
- Each such span also carries the executing pod inline: `k8s.pod.name` and
  `dt.smartscape.k8s_pod` (a `K8S_POD-…` Smartscape id). So "the pod that ran
  this session" is one drill off the filtered span list — no separate join.
- **Deep-link target is `traces`, not `genai`.** The `genai` spec is a
  Smartscape *node* list (`smartscapeNodes "GENAI_AGENT"…`) with no span
  attributes — a business-id facet on it silently matches nothing. The
  `traces` spec (`fetch spans`) is where the facet composes and Enter opens the
  waterfall.
- **Some apps put base62-encoded UUIDs in their URLs.** A URL may carry a
  short id — e.g. `…/chat?id=conv_<22ch>` — where `<22ch>` is the span-attribute
  UUID encoded in **base62 with the `0-9A-Za-z` alphabet**, big-endian over the
  16 UUID bytes. Decoding round-trips exactly (validated both directions against
  a live tenant), so a chat/investigation URL maps to a `traces` facet with
  **no DOM scraping** — decode the short id, filter the business-id field. (When
  the canonical UUID isn't in the page's static DOM, URL-decode is the robust
  path.) The extension implements this as a rule `decode: "base62-uuid"`
  transform (`extension/content.js`, `default-rules.js`).
- **Watch span retention.** On tenants where spans retain for only ~10 days, a
  decoded conversation/task id that returns empty is almost always an *old*
  conversation past retention, not a codec bug — verify the codec against a
  conversation from the last few days (e.g. one from
  `summarize count(), by:{<app>.conversation_id}` over 7d). The bridge only
  works for recent activity, which is the debugging case anyway.

## 2. TUI extension model — how to add a view

The catalog is **declarative data**, not screens. Adding an entity/signal view
is a `catalog.Spec` literal; the generic `tableView` engine renders it.

```go
var myViewSpec = &Spec{
    Name, Aliases, Kind,       // KindEntity | KindSignal
    Desc,
    Query   func(Scope) string // scope-aware DQL; compose s.Entity/s.Arg/s.TraceID
    Columns  []Column          // Field or Value; Width (0=flex); Right; Class; Sort
    Entity   func(rec) *Entity // the entity a row stands for (scope for drills)
    Drills   map[string]string // 'l'→logs, 's'→traces, 'm'→metrics, …
    EntityScoped bool          // entity view whose Query composes s.Entity
    EnterTarget  string        // k9s containment: enter → child view (detail moves to 'd')
    EnterArg     func(rec) string // census row → typed browser via Scope.Arg
    Trace        func(rec) string // row's trace id (log→trace, trace→waterfall)
    Enrich   *EnrichSpec       // batched sparkline columns
}
```

Key design points learned:

- **`Scope` carries everything a query composes**: `Entity`, `Timeframe`,
  `Arg` (generic-browser node type), `TraceID`. Keep it small; add a field
  rather than smuggling state through globals.
- **`Spec.UsesScope()`** (`Kind==Signal || EntityScoped`) decides whether the
  pin (`.`) and the scope crumb apply — a view that ignores scope must not
  *claim* it in the breadcrumb.
- **`EnrichSpec`** = one batched `timeseries ... by:{…}, filter: in(…)` per
  refresh. `Key(rec)` is the row's join value, `By` the result field carrying
  it; results land under `EnrichKey(alias)` and render via `SparkColumn`.
  Failures degrade to blank cells by design — never surface an enrichment error.
- **Curated where curation adds value, introspection everywhere else.** The
  generic `resources` view browses *any* Smartscape type from the census; only
  pods/hosts/services/etc. get bespoke columns.
- **Two special `Drills` targets** beyond view names: `"metrics"` (canned
  charts) and `"trace"`/`"trace-logs"` (waterfall / trace-scoped logs).
  `EnterTarget: "waterfall"` is the sentinel for the bespoke waterfall screen.

### Bespoke screens (not table-driven)

`home`, `query` (DQL escape hatch), `nav` (smartscape navigator — overview /
type browser / walk, see ../design/smartscape-navigator.md), `waterfall`,
`relations`, `detail`, `inspector`, `metrics` each implement the `viewModel`
interface directly.
Optional capability interfaces let the app treat them uniformly:
`selectionProvider` (pin/relations/yank/open), `dqlProvider` (ctrl+q reveal),
`traceProvider` (waterfall's trace id).

---

## 3. bubbletea message-flow patterns

- **Views mutate in place (pointer receivers) and stay alive when covered**, so
  `esc` restores them with data + cursor intact. The breadcrumb stack owns the
  lifetimes.
- **Stale results are dropped by `(owner, seq)`, never by cancellation.** The
  DQL executor prints cancellation notices to stderr, which would tear the
  alternate screen — so in-flight queries run to completion and old results are
  discarded on arrival. Every async query is a `tea.Cmd` goroutine.
- **Distinct owners disambiguate multiplexed queries on one view's seq:**
  `enrichOwner{v}`, `nameOwner{v}`, `panelOwner{v, idx}`. A view's list query,
  its enrichment query, and (home) its per-panel queries all share the view's
  `seq` generation but route by owner type.
- **`dataMsg` is broadcast to every view on both the live and `prev` stacks
  (deduped)** so a parent still loading below a drill-down completes, and detail
  pages forward results to their lazily-started tabs. Views drop results they
  don't own.
- **Every view that fires its own queries needs a `seq` generation guard** —
  `tableView`, `waterfall`, `relations`, `inspector`, `metrics`, *and* `home`
  (its per-panel results). A slow result from a superseded refresh (e.g. after
  a timeframe change) must be dropped, or it overwrites fresher data. This is
  the one an early `home` implementation missed.

### A view must never claim a scope it didn't apply

The subtlest class of bug the review found. A global pin (`.`) is handed to the
next command-bar/hotkey jump — but only if that view's query can actually
compose the pinned entity. Two ways the naïve `if UsesScope() { scope.Entity =
pin }` lies:

1. The query **ignores** the entity for that type (a `SERVICE` pin on `:pods` —
   `k8sScopeFilter` returns `""`; a K8s pin on `:vulnerabilities` —
   `VulnEntityFilter` returns `""` because K8s ids don't match the
   `related_entities` id era). The list is unfiltered but the breadcrumb reads
   `pods (checkout)`: data presented as scoped that never was.
2. The query **composes a filter that matches nothing** — a filter on a field
   the record type doesn't carry. Silently empty but labelled as scoped, so the
   user concludes there's no data. (The original example here was a `HOST` pin
   on `:traces`; note that no longer holds universally — on OneAgent fullstack
   tenants spans **do** carry `dt.smartscape.host`, see §1.3 — so pick a field
   the target record type genuinely lacks when reasoning about this case.)

The fix is `Spec.CanScope(tf, e)`, honest **by construction**: if
`Query(scoped) == Query(unscoped)` the entity had no effect → don't apply or
claim it (catches case 1 and any future scope-ignoring view for free); an
optional `Scopable(e)` predicate refines case 2 (traces → `SpanScopable`). When
a pin doesn't apply, navigate **unscoped** and say so in the status line rather
than refuse — `:pods` should always give you pods. Drill-down navigation is
type-correct by construction (workload→pods, etc.); only the pin injects
arbitrary types, so it is the only path that needs the guard.

**General principle:** a breadcrumb/header that shows scope is a *promise the
query kept*. Derive the label from what the query actually did, never from what
the user intended.

- **`claimKey`** (a no-op `tea.Cmd` returning `nil`) lets a child consume a key
  the app would otherwise act on — e.g. `esc` that clears a filter instead of
  popping the stack. bubbletea discards `nil` messages, so returning a real
  no-op command is how you say "handled, do nothing."
- **`InputActive()` gating**: while a text input (filter, command bar, query
  editor) owns the keyboard, global single-letter keys (`q`, `x`, `.`, hotkeys)
  must not fire. Every view reports this; the app checks it before its own
  key switch.

---

## 3b. Visual design (theme package)

- **The palette is adaptive with explicit fallbacks.** Every color in
  `internal/tui/theme` is a `lipgloss.CompleteAdaptiveColor`: truecolor hex
  (Catppuccin Mocha/Latte) plus hand-picked ANSI-256 and ANSI-16 fallbacks per
  background flavor. lipgloss picks the variant for the terminal's capability
  and background — never rely on automatic downsampling for the 16-color tier,
  it picks ugly approximations.
- **Selection is a gutter bar + background wash, not `Reverse(true)`.**
  Reverse video inverts whatever colors a cell already has (unreadable over
  class-colored cells); a fixed `SelBg` + dropping per-cell colors on the
  selected row reads as one calm bar. All list views share the pattern:
  `theme.Gutter.Render("▌") + theme.Selected.Render(pad(row, width-1))` — and
  every row budget must account for that 1-cell gutter (the waterfall's column
  math missed it first: rows overflowed and truncated their last column).
- **One global spinner, app-driven.** Views expose `Busy() bool` (optional
  `busyReporter` interface); the app runs a single 90ms `tea.Tick` loop while
  the *visible* view is busy and advances a frame counter in `theme`. Views
  just render `theme.Spin()` — no per-view spinner models. The test helper
  `deliver` must drop `spinnerTickMsg` (like `dataMsg`) or a busy view re-arms
  the tick forever and the test hangs.
- **lipgloss has no border titles** — the home panels hand-roll their boxes
  (`╭─ ● title ─…─╮` + `│` sides) precisely so the title can live in the top
  border. `lipgloss.Width` (ANSI-aware) does the fill math on styled titles.
- **Overlays replace the body, they don't composite.** lipgloss v1 can't
  layer; the command palette / help / timeframe picker render *instead of* the
  body via `lipgloss.Place`. Design overlays to be self-sufficient, not
  peek-through.
- Styled-string layout: `pad`/`cell` (lipgloss.Width) and `ansi.Truncate` are
  safe on already-styled strings; plain `fmt.Sprintf("%-20s", styled)` is not
  (counts escape bytes).
- **`wrap()` (lipgloss `Width(w).Render`) pads every line to the full width**
  with trailing spaces. Any "does this value fit inline?" check against
  wrapped output always fails — strip the padding first (`wrapLines` in
  render.go trims each line). This silently pushed every short string value
  into the two-line block layout before it was caught on a live drive.

## 3c. Typed values & inspector navigation (render.go / inspector.go)

- **`renderValue` classifies record values for display**: entity ids (both
  eras match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*-[0-9A-F]{16}$`, type = the prefix) become
  accent links; RFC3339 strings render absolute + "· 23m ago"; `*duration*`
  keys holding digit strings render `FormatNs` + raw ns; numeric strings get
  thousands separators — **except identifier-ish keys** (`isIDKey`:
  `aws.account.id` is a label, not a quantity); 16/32-hex are opaque uids;
  maps/arrays and strings that parse as JSON render as an indented
  syntax-highlighted block (keys sky, strings green, numbers peach). The raw
  value is kept beside the styled lines for yank.
- **Density first: scalars and arrays are one line by default.** Values too
  big for their line collapse to a truncated compact preview (`compact`:
  whitespace-squashed string / one-line JSON) marked with a dim `▸`; enter
  expands to the full block (`▾`). **JSON objects are the exception** — they
  read as structure, so they default to the expanded block (enter collapses).
  The earlier layout (label line + indented block for anything long) read
  nicely but wasted half the screen — user feedback killed it within an hour
  of a live drive.
- **The inspector has a field cursor, not a line scroller**: j/k moves over
  fields, the viewport follows, and the selected row's label line gets the
  gutter-bar + wash treatment (per-value colors drop on that line — strip
  ANSI before washing). enter follows the selection: entity id → its detail
  page, `trace*` 32-hex → the waterfall, expandable → toggle. Arrays whose
  elements are all entity ids (`affected_entity_ids`) explode into one
  navigable `key[i]` row each.
- **Selection follows the cursor**: `Selection()` returns the highlighted
  link's entity (falling back to the page entity), so pin/relations/open act
  on what the user is looking at. `y` goes through the `yankProvider`
  interface (app checks it before the entity-id fallback) and copies the
  selected field's raw value. The record's own `id` field is styled opaque,
  not as a link — a self-link is noise (but `id_classic` may be a *different*
  entity and stays navigable).
- **Id-only traversal must back-fill the name.** An entity link carries no
  name; the detail page's tabs share a pointer to the page entity
  (`scope.Entity = &v.entity`), and when the details-tab fetch returns,
  `detailView` copies the learned name in. Unstarted signal tabs then compose
  it — load-bearing for K8s entities, whose log scoping matches plain
  `k8s.*` names (§1.3). Without this, logs on a traversed pod are silently
  empty.

## 3d. Metrics charts (btop-style)

- Filled braille areas (`PlotFilled`), not line plots; per-row **vertical
  gradient** via `theme.Gradient` — top row full series color, lower rows
  blend toward the background ink. Only the truecolor tier fades; 256/16
  fallbacks keep the flat base color (downsampled blends look muddy).
- **Scaling is honest**: zero baseline for filled charts (min-based
  autoscale exaggerates noise into drama), and `%` metrics render as a true
  0–100 gauge — a host at 3% CPU *should* look nearly empty; the header
  carries the numbers (`last` value prominent, min/avg/max dim).
- Charts divide the body height (`(h - 2 - 2n) / n` rows each, clamped 2–9),
  y-axis max/min labels sit on the first/last braille row (`┤` ticks), and a
  single shared time axis (`└ 2h ago … now`) closes the page — every chart
  spans the same window, so per-chart axes would be noise.
- Unit-aware formatting: `"B"` → IEC bytes (a 15.3 GiB axis label, not
  "16106.1M"), `%`/`ms` attach suffixes. Shared as `catalog.FormatUnit`
  (charts, vitals rows) and `catalog.FormatUnitShort` (dense table cells:
  one-decimal percent, spaceless bytes, k8s `500m` millicores).
- **A sparkline alone misleads**: `MiniGraph` normalizes to its own range,
  so a flat 3% and a flat 90% CPU render identically. Every spark column
  pairs the mini-graph with the right-aligned latest value, and the vitals
  block adds a btop-style meter for `%` series — `█…░` scaled 0–100 and
  class-colored by load (ok < 75 ≤ warn < 90 ≤ error) — because percent has
  an absolute scale the trend can't show.

## 4. Server-side scope beats client-side filter for capped lists

A subtle correctness bug: jumping to a limit-capped list (e.g. pods, 800 cap)
and applying a **client-side** `/`-filter can miss a row that fell outside the
fetched page. When you know the exact target (a pod name from a home-panel
warning), push it into the **query** as `Scope.Entity` so the server narrows,
not the client. See the home "kubernetes warnings" panel action and
`k8sScopeFilter` for `K8S_POD`.

Corollary: the k8s-warnings panel looks back 24h, so its jump must widen the
timeframe to 24h too — otherwise a pod that died hours ago is gone from a 2h
window.

---

## 5. Verifying the TUI live

The TUI refuses to start in an auto-detected agent environment and captured
panes strip ANSI — so drive it in tmux:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s t -x 150 -y 40 \
  "$BIN tui --no-agent 2>err.log; sleep 60"
tmux send-keys -t t 4        # one keypress per call — batching coalesces into one KeyMsg
tmux capture-pane -t t -p    # -e to see the reverse-video selected row
```

- **`--no-agent`** is mandatory from a Claude/agent session (agent env vars
  propagate into tmux).
- **One `send-keys` per keypress.** Multiple keys in one call can merge into a
  single bubbletea `KeyMsg` ("jjjjj") that matches nothing.
- Stress tiny terminals (`-x 60 -y 12`) — layout math must not underflow
  (`strings.Repeat` with negative counts panics; clamp bar/column widths).
- A rich demo tenant with a K8s cluster, AWS inventory, Postgres, GenAI, RUM,
  and live problems/vulns exercises every view in one place.

### Testing without a TTY

bubbletea models are pure (`Update(msg) → cmd`): drive with synthetic messages,
chase returned navigation `tea.Cmd`s back into the app, and seed rows via the
`dataSource.runFn` seam (never hit HTTP). Assert on navigation, scope
composition, and DQL strings. Catalog `Query` templates are golden-tested
against fixture scopes — cheap regression protection for scope composition.

## 6. Live-exploration workflow (how the DQL above was validated)

The DQL facts in §1 came from a fan-out of read-only probe agents, one per
domain (K8s entities, K8s metrics, traces, AWS, edges, enrichment, breadth),
each running `dtctl query '…' -o json` against the tenant with a strict schema
for validated-query / fields / gotchas output. Rules that made it reliable:

- Always small limits and a 2h window; widen only when empty.
- Treat empty results as suspicious (silent-empty trap) — verify non-empty
  before declaring a field name "validated."
- Report **exact copy-paste DQL**, field names with one example value each, and
  every gotcha hit. The gotchas were worth more than the happy-path queries.

This front-loaded exploration is why nearly every query worked on first live
drive — the traps were already known before a line of view code was written.

## 7. security.events (validated live, demo tenant)

The facts behind the security workspace (`catalog/security.go`):

- **Two report levels, two jobs.** `VULNERABILITY_STATE_REPORT_EVENT`
  records exist at `event.level == "VULNERABILITY"` (the rollup: full
  markdown description, complete `davis_assessment.*`, remediation,
  references — but **counts only**, no entity ids) and `"ENTITY"` (one row
  per affected entity: `affected_entity.*`, the vulnerable component,
  process-instance ids, `related_entities.*.{ids,names}`, and — for CODE
  vulns — `entry_points.entry_point_jsons`). Any rollup query MUST filter
  the level: summarizing both levels into one `by:{vulnerability.id}`
  bucket lets `takeLast` pick fields from either row shape.
- **Array membership pins**: `in("SERVICE-…", related_entities.services.ids)`
  works with plain strings (legacy-era ids — no `toSmartscapeId`).
  SERVICE and HOST ids are identical strings across both ID eras;
  `PROCESS-<hex>` ↔ `PROCESS_GROUP_INSTANCE-<hex>` share the hex suffix
  (checked across every distinct PGI in 7d of attack records), so a
  modern PROCESS pin swaps the prefix. K8s workload/cluster ids in
  `related_entities` do NOT match Smartscape ids (`CLOUD_APPLICATION-…` /
  legacy `KUBERNETES_CLUSTER-…`) — K8s pins refuse honestly.
- **Attacks carry no `vulnerability.id`.** RAP `DETECTION_FINDING` records
  link to code-level vulns only via `vulnerability.code_location.name`
  (exact string match). *(Not reproducible on OneAgent/OTel-demo tenants:* their
  `DETECTION_FINDING` records are web-attack / simulated-cloud findings with
  `vulnerability.code_location.name` null throughout — the code-location
  linkage only shows up for code-level RAP attacks, which neither tenant had.)
  For library vulns the only linkage is
  entity-based (detections on the affected process groups) — the page's
  attacks tab labels nothing causal and `filter false` keeps it honestly
  empty when the hop resolves no matchable entities (an unfiltered fetch
  would present the tenant's whole attack stream as "this vuln's
  attacks"). `filter false` is legal DQL (constant-filter warning, empty
  result).
- **Attack records are fat and well-stamped**: `finding.*`
  (type/severity/action Blocked|Audited), `entry_point.payload` +
  `url.path` + `function.name` + structured `user_controlled_inputs`
  (with `is_malicious` spans), `actor.ips`, full `http.request.header.*`,
  `trace.id`/`span.id`, `dt.smartscape_source.id` (=`PROCESS-…`), both-era
  process/host ids, and `dt.entity.process_group` — which is why
  `legacyField` grew a PROCESS_GROUP arm.
- **`expand entry_points.entry_point_jsons` works** (one row per entry
  point; each element is a JSON *string* — parse client-side, tolerant of
  malformed docs). Payload user-input values arrive masked (`*****`).
- **State reports are periodic snapshots** (24h floor still right); a
  resolved vuln stops being re-reported, so the page's detail fetch looks
  back 7d. Change events (`VULNERABILITY_STATUS_CHANGE_EVENT` /
  `…ASSESSMENT_CHANGE_EVENT`) are sparse — the timeline floors at 30d.
- **glamour in bubbletea**: don't use `glamour.WithAutoStyle()` — it
  issues a fresh OSC background query mid-session (bubbletea eats the
  reply; ~100ms stall + stray input risk). Pick
  `WithStandardStyle("dark"/"light")` from `lipgloss.HasDarkBackground()`,
  whose verdict is already cached from the first styled frame.
